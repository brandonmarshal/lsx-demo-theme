### **Story / Personal Example**

My earliest fishing days were full of excitement and uncertainty. On that first trip to the Huttenspruit, I had no idea what to expect. I remember the sun just cresting the hills and the river glinting in the soft light—a scene that felt almost dreamlike.

I cast my line with more hope than technique, but luck was on my side. After a few anxious minutes, I felt a tug. My hands trembled as I reeled in what would become my very first fish from these legendary waters.

### **Tips / Advice / How-To**

#### **Fish Species**

The fish I caught that day was a small yellowfish—a common but spirited resident of the Huttenspruit. Yellowfish are known for their fight and beauty, and even a young angler like me couldn’t miss their golden scales and determined pull.

#### **What I Learned**

That catch taught me a lesson I’ve carried with me ever since: patience and attention are everything in fishing. I learned to watch the water, to listen for subtle clues, and to respect the fish and the river. Every catch since has been built on that first foundation.

### **Context / Research / Background**

The Huttenspruit is renowned in KwaZulu-Natal for its biodiversity and serene landscapes. Anglers often come here in search of yellowfish, tilapia, and the occasional catfish. The river’s calm pools and gentle runs are perfect for both beginners and seasoned fishers.

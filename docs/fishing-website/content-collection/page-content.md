### **About Page**

**Brandon‚Äôs Story Intro:**  
 I‚Äôve been fishing since I was a boy on the banks of the Huttenspruit. What started as a way to spend quiet mornings grew into a lifelong passion. Fishing has shaped my weekends, my friendships, and my love for the outdoors.

**Timeline of Fishing Journey:**

* **Childhood:** First rod, first fish, endless summer days.

* **Teen Years:** Learning the rivers of KwaZulu-Natal, trying every lure I could get my hands on.

* **Adulthood:** Exploring wider KZN, finding hidden spots, teaching friends the joy of fishing.

* **Today:** Sharing my adventures and stories online, hoping to inspire others.

**Why Huttenspruit Matters:**  
 The Huttenspruit isn‚Äôt just a stream ‚Äî it‚Äôs home. Its clean waters and rocky pools hold Yellowfish, Tilapia, and Catfish. It‚Äôs where I learned patience, respect for nature, and the thrill of the chase.

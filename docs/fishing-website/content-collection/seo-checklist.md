## *Brandon’s Fishing Adventures*

Use this checklist as a guide for tips and tricks you can apply to any piece of content to get some quick SEO wins. Here’s a complete SEO checklist you can run through for your site:

---

## **0\. Deliverables**

### **SEO Checklist**

* Install and configure **Yoast SEO**.

* Ensure only **one H1 per page** (Yoast will flag duplicates).

* Write **optimised meta descriptions** for every page/post.

* Use **descriptive, clean URLs** (`/fish/smallmouth-yellowfish/`, `/blog/fishing-trip-huttenspruit/`).

* Add **alt text** for all images (species name, location, action).

* Submit an **XML sitemap** through Yoast → Search Appearance.

* Connect the site to **Google Search Console** and verify ownership.

### **Keyword Strategy**

* Identify **5–10 core keywords** related to fishing and your location. Examples:

  * Huttenspruit fishing

  * KwaZulu-Natal fish species

  * Yellowfish South Africa

  * River fishing tips ZA

  * Catch and release techniques

* Map each keyword to a specific page (e.g., “Yellowfish” → `/fish/yellowfish/`, “Fishing Tips” → `/blog/tips/`).

### **Metadata Specs**

* **Title length:** 55–60 characters

* **Meta description:** 150–160 characters

* Include the **primary keyword** near the start of each meta title.

---

## **1\. Technical Setup**

* Ensure **only one H1 per page**.

* Add a **title and meta description** for each page and post.

* Use **clean, descriptive URLs** (no underscores or numbers).

* Submit your **XML sitemap** via Yoast → *Search Appearance*.

* Connect your site to **Google Search Console**.

* Verify that your **robots.txt** allows search engine indexing of public pages.

* Check for **canonical tags** on duplicate or similar content.

* Install **SSL certificate** (HTTPS enabled) for security and ranking benefits.

---

## **2\. Content Optimisation**

* Place the **primary keyword** in the H1, early H2, and within the first 100 words.

* Write **compelling meta descriptions** (150–160 characters) that encourage clicks.

* Add **alt text** for every image (e.g., “Smallmouth Yellowfish caught at Huttenspruit”).

* Use **synonyms and related terms** (e.g., “river angling”, “freshwater fishing”, “catch and release”).

* Create **internal links** to connect related content:

  * Blog posts → relevant fish species pages.

  * Fish species pages → blogs about fishing those species.

* Include **outgoing links** to credible sources (e.g., conservation sites, South African fishing regulations).

---

## **3\. Structure & Readability**

* Use **short paragraphs** (2–3 sentences).

* Include **H2 and H3 headings** to break up content.

* Use **bullet lists** for clarity where possible.

* Maintain **ZA English** spelling and tone.

* Write in an **active, conversational voice** — “I caught my first Yellowfish…” instead of “A Yellowfish was caught.”

* Use Yoast’s **readability analysis** (aim for green bullets).

---

## **4\. Blog Posts**

* Each post should focus on **one keyword/topic** (e.g., “Yellowfish Fishing at Huttenspruit”).

* Include **location-based terms** like “KwaZulu-Natal” or “South Africa” naturally.

* Add **internal links** to related content (e.g., Fish Archive, About Page).

* End posts with a **CTA** (e.g., “Discover the fish of KZN rivers”).

* Include **featured images** with descriptive filenames and captions.

* Use **categories and tags** consistently (Adventures, Tips, Conservation, Gear, Seasons).

---

## **5\. Images & Media**

* Optimise filenames (e.g., `smallmouth-yellowfish-huttenspruit.jpg`).

* Compress images (using TinyPNG or Imagify).

* Add **alt text** with descriptive details (“Brandon fishing at dawn on Huttenspruit”).

* Use **descriptive captions** when relevant (e.g., “A Sharptooth Catfish caught during winter”).

* Use **lazy loading** for faster performance.

* Add **structured data for images** via Yoast if applicable.

---

## **6\. Ongoing**

* Review Yoast SEO analysis per post/page (aim for **green lights**, but don’t over-optimise).

* Update blog content regularly with new adventures or fishing tips — search engines reward **freshness**.

* Monitor **Google Search Console** for impressions, clicks, and top queries.

* Track site speed and accessibility via **PageSpeed Insights**.

* Check for **broken links** monthly using an SEO plugin or Screaming Frog.

* Review your **analytics** to identify top-performing pages and improve weaker ones.

---

## **7\. Internal Links**

* Add **relevant internal links** throughout posts. Example:

  * From a blog post about “Fishing in KZN Rivers” → link to “Fish Archive” or “About Brandon”.

* Create **content clusters**:

  * Pillar page → “Fish of Huttenspruit”

  * Supporting posts → “Best Baits for Yellowfish”, “Seasonal Catfish Behavior”

* Avoid dead ends — ensure every page links to at least one other relevant page.

* Use **breadcrumbs** (Yoast can enable this) for better navigation and SEO context.

---

## **8\. Outgoing Links**

* Link to **trusted external sources**:

  * South African fishing authorities.

  * Conservation organisations.

  * Reputable fishing blogs.

* Choose links that **enhance credibility** and support your facts (e.g., fish species info).

* Periodically check that all outgoing links are still live and relevant.

---

## **9\. Anchor Text**

* Use **descriptive anchor text**:

  * ✅ “Learn about the Smallmouth Yellowfish”

  * ❌ “Click here”

* Keep it **short and specific**, matching the destination page’s focus.

* Avoid linking entire sentences — stick to **key phrases**.

---

## **10\. HTTPS (Secure Browsing)**

* Ensure **entire site runs on HTTPS**.

* Renew SSL certificates automatically (most hosts do this).

* Check that all internal links use **https://** instead of **http://**.

* Secure browsing boosts **trust and SEO ranking**.

---

## **11\. Mobile-Friendliness**

* Confirm site is **fully responsive** on phones and tablets.

* Check that buttons, forms, and CTAs are **easy to tap**.

* Avoid large popups that block the screen on mobile.

* Test regularly with Google’s **Mobile-Friendly Test**.

* Ensure fast load time by **optimising images and scripts**.

---

## **12\. Synonyms and Clear Themes**

* Keep each page focused on **one clear topic** (e.g., Fish Species, Blog, Contact).

* Use **related phrases** to add depth without repeating keywords:

  * “Fishing stories”, “River angling”, “Outdoor adventures”.

* Write naturally — for humans first, search engines second.

* Group related pages under a consistent **content theme** (e.g., “Huttenspruit Life”).

---

## **13\. Conversational Tone**

* Write like you speak — friendly, natural, and personal.

* Use contractions and short sentences.

* Optimise for **voice search** (questions and answers):

  * “What fish can I catch in KZN?”

  * “Where does Brandon fish?”

* Focus on **authentic storytelling** — your personality is the brand.

---

## **14\. FAQ with Schema Data**

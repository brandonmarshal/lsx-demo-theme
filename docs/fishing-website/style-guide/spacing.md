# **Custom Spacing Scale**

## *Brandon‚Äôs Fishing Block Theme*

**Guidelines for modular spacing and visual hierarchy**  
This spacing scale is tailored for **Brandon‚Äôs Fishing Block Theme**, designed to feel **natural, airy, and outdoorsy**, while remaining consistent and predictable for **theme.json** implementation. It ensures that spacing across pages‚Äîespecially those highlighting fish species such as *Largemouth Bass*, *Smallmouth Bass*, and other featured catches‚Äîfeels balanced and rhythmically aligned with the visual tone of the brand.

### **0\. Deliverables**

- [ ] Base spacing unit and modular scale.

- [ ] Named spacing tokens for UI, content, and layout.

- [ ] Small, medium, and large spacing use cases.

- [ ] Responsive spacing rules for mobile.

- [ ] `theme.json` partial for WordPress implementation.

### **1\. Purpose**

The purpose of this custom spacing system is to:

* Create rhythm and consistency for all layouts.

* Ensure a unified spacing system across all UI elements.

* Support predictable scaling across different breakpoints.

* Enhance the natural, open layout style that matches Brandon‚Äôs fishing stories and imagery‚Äîespecially the visual rhythm between fish species like *Largemouth Bass*, *Smallmouth Bass*, and *Tigerfish* photography sections.

---

### **2\. Base Unit & Increments**

**Base Unit:** 4px (0.25rem)  
**Increments:** Multiples of 4px, grouped in meaningful steps (8px, 16px, 24px, etc.) for real-world layouts.

This scale provides precise control for UI components while maintaining natural proportions for image-heavy layouts, such as fish guides and story sections.

---

### **3\. Naming Convention**

**Format:** `spacing-[token] ‚Üí [value]`

**Examples:**

* spacing-10 ‚Üí 0.25rem / 4px

* spacing-20 ‚Üí 0.5rem / 8px

* spacing-30 ‚Üí 0.75rem / 12px

* spacing-40 ‚Üí 1rem / 16px

* spacing-50 ‚Üí 1.5rem / 24px

* spacing-60 ‚Üí 2rem / 32px

* spacing-70 ‚Üí 3rem / 48px

* spacing-80 ‚Üí 4rem / 64px

* spacing-90 ‚Üí 5rem / 80px

* spacing-100 ‚Üí 6rem / 96px

This naming convention aligns seamlessly with **theme.json** for WordPress and can be referenced directly in CSS variables or design tokens.

### **4\. Usage**

**Small Spacing:** 4‚Äì12px  
 Use for micro-interactions‚Äîbuttons, input padding, or inline elements such as icons beside species names (*e.g.*, ‚ÄúLargemouth Bass üé£‚Äù).

**Medium Spacing:** 16‚Äì32px  
 Use for paragraph gaps, card padding, or spacing between fish profile components in the CPT layout.

**Large Spacing:** 48‚Äì80px  
 Use for full section dividers, image blocks, or spacious layout zones around major visuals (like *Smallmouth Bass* hero images or gallery sections).

---

### **5\. Responsive Rules**

Spacing adapts proportionally to maintain usability across devices.  
 **Suggested Breakpoints:**

* **Mobile:** \<768px

* **Tablet:** 768‚Äì1024px

* **Desktop:** \>1024px

**Guidelines:**

* Reduce padding/margins on mobile for compact layouts.

* Maintain visual balance between fish images and story text.

* Preserve breathing space around highlighted species (e.g., Bass or Tigerfish) for clear focus on visuals.

---

### **6\. Implementation**

* Add the scale to **theme.json** under `settings.spacing` for global consistency.

* Map spacing tokens to design tools (e.g., **Figma variables**) for cross-platform parity.

* Provide fallback values for legacy support in non-JSON themes.

* Use consistent spacing classes in template parts such as header, gallery, and fish species blocks.

### **7\. Spacing Strategy for Brandon‚Äôs Fishing Block Theme**

**Base Unit:** 4px (0.25rem)  
 **Scale Progression:** Multiples of 4px, grouped in meaningful steps

**Use Case Mapping:**

* Small paddings/margins ‚Üí 4‚Äì12px

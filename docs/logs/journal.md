# Week 1 Developer Journal

## Entry 1: LocalWP & Environment Setup
Installed WPStudio, set up my first local WordPress site. Faced a permissions error, solved by restarting my computer. Learned about the benefits of a local environment for experimentation.

## Entry 2: GitHub Onboarding & Forking
Forked the starter repo and cloned it locally. The difference between forking and cloning is now clear to me. Used VS Code and terminal for the first time together.

## Entry 3: First Commit & Pull Request
Edited README.md and added my first markdown file. Committed with a message describing the change, then pushed to my fork. Opened a pull requestâ€”felt accomplished! Noticed the importance of clear commit messages and PR descriptions

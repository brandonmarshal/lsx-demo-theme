# Work Logs

Each intern must maintain a set of log files in this folder. These logs serve as a personal journal and a record of your time spent on tasks. Keeping detailed logs helps the team understand your progress and makes it easier to review your work.

## Structure

Logs are organised by week. Create a file called `week-01.md` for the first week, `week-02.md` for the second week, and so on. At the end of the internship, write a longer reflection in `reflections.md`.

### Daily Entries

For each working day, record the following information:

- **Date** – The date of the entry (e.g. `2025‑09‑01`).
- **Hours** – Total hours spent that day (copied from Harvest).
- **Task** – A short description of the task or issue you worked on. If applicable, reference the issue number (e.g. `#12`).
- **Description** – A more detailed description of what you did, including any challenges or breakthroughs.
- **Next Steps** – What you plan to do next or questions you need answered.

### Example

```markdown
## 2025‑09‑01

- **Hours:** 4.0
- **Task:** Installed LocalWP and set up a new WordPress site (#1)
- **Description:** Followed the LocalWP installation guide and set up a fresh site. Installed the Twenty Twenty‑Four theme and activated the Create Block Theme plugin.
- **Next Steps:** Create a new GitHub repository and link it to the local project.
```

### Time Tracking with Harvest

We use [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) for time tracking. Install the Harvest browser extension and start a timer whenever you work on a task or GitHub issue. Include a short description in the timer (e.g. “Week 1 – clone repo and install dependencies”). At the end of the day, copy this description and the recorded duration into your log entry. You can write draft notes in your log file throughout the day and refine them before committing.

### Weekly Reflection

At the end of each week, summarise your overall progress at the top of the weekly log file. Use the “Week X Submission” issue template to share this reflection with the team.

### Reflection Log

Use `reflections.md` to write a longer retrospective at the end of your internship. Reflect on what you learned, what tools and practices worked well, and how you plan to continue developing your skills.

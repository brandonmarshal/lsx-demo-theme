# Design System Commitment

## Current Status

-   Design system variables in Figma are complete.
-   Component and pattern collection from the existing prototype is in progress.

## Focus This Week

I am extracting components and patterns from the prototype and rebuilding them correctly as reusable Figma components using variables and instances.
This includes converting text, icons, and layout elements into proper components to ensure long-term scalability and consistency.

I have now established a clear, repeatable workflow for collecting and organizing components, which is already improving speed and efficiency.

## Commitment (By Wednesday)

By next Wednesday, I expect to have:

-   Collected and rebuilt **most core components** from the prototype
-   Reconstructed the majority of patterns using proper component instances
-   Applied variables consistently across collected components
-   Started using **Figma MCP** to begin extracting components into the GitHub repository

This will establish a solid foundation for continued refinement and handoff.

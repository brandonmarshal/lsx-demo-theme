# Week 21 Planning (2026-02-02 to 2026-02-06)

## Weekly Goals

-   [ ] **Goal 1**: Start building and iterating on Agent skills to support the Sixcats design system and pattern extraction.
-   [ ] **Goal 2**: Complete collection of the remaining Sixcats components and patterns, with variables correctly applied.
-   [ ] **Goal 3**: Set up and use the Figma MCP (or equivalent) to retrieve patterns and structured data from Figma.
-   [ ] **Goal 4**: Get a Sixcats WordPress dev server running and begin importing/extracting patterns from Figma into code.
-   [ ] **Goal 5**: Test extracted patterns on the dev site and refine the design-to-code workflow.

## Key Tasks

### Monday (2026-02-02)

-   [ ] **Agent Skills & Automation**
    -   [ ] Begin implementing Agent skills for:
        -   [ ] Visual colour palette extraction / WCAG checks (as needed).
        -   [ ] Extracting Figma patterns/components into structured JSON.
    -   [ ] Define clear inputs/outputs and a minimal “MVP” flow for at least one Agent skill.
-   [ ] **Component & Pattern Collection**
    -   [ ] Collect the remaining components and patterns from outstanding Sixcats pages.
    -   [ ] Ensure design system variables are correctly applied to newly collected components.
-   [ ] **Planning & Logging**
    -   [ ] Update planning/tracking docs for Week 21.
    -   [ ] Log any issues, unknowns, or blockers encountered while starting the Agent work.

### Tuesday (2026-02-03)

-   [ ] **Component & Pattern Collection**
    -   [ ] Finish collecting the “last bunch” of components and patterns.
    -   [ ] Double-check variable assignments on newly collected components/patterns.
-   [ ] **MCP / Integration Setup**
    -   [ ] Set up the MCP (or equivalent integration) to connect to Figma.
    -   [ ] Configure the MCP/Agent to start retrieving patterns (or pattern data) from Figma.
    -   [ ] Document the retrieval process (what commands you run, what JSON you get back, etc.).
-   [ ] **Design to Code Preparation**
    -   [ ] Identify a small set of patterns to use as your first “design → code” test set.

### Wednesday (2026-02-04)

-   [ ] **Dev Server Setup**
    -   [ ] Set up a local/dev WordPress server specifically for the Sixcats theme.
    -   [ ] Ensure the Sixcats theme (or a working dev copy) is installed and active on the dev site.
-   [ ] **Pattern Extraction to Code**
    -   [ ] Use the MCP/Agent to retrieve one or more target patterns from Figma.
    -   [ ] Translate the retrieved pattern data into WordPress-compatible code (patterns/templates/components).
    -   [ ] Log any issues, mismatches, or gaps between the Figma structure and the WordPress pattern system.
-   [ ] **Ongoing Issue Logging**
    -   [ ] Continue logging any problems, edge cases, or ideas for improving the workflow.

### Thursday (2026-02-05)

-   [ ] **Pattern Extraction & Refinement**
    -   [ ] Continue extracting additional patterns from Figma into code.
    -   [ ] Refine the mapping between Figma structure (frames, components, tokens) and WordPress patterns/templates.
-   [ ] **Dev Site Testing**
    -   [ ] Add/update extracted patterns in the dev site.
    -   [ ] Test how they render and behave in the block editor and on the front end.
    -   [ ] Note any design mismatches or variable issues that need design system updates.
-   [ ] **Agent/MCP Iteration**
    -   [ ] Adjust Agent prompts/logic or MCP setup based on what you learn from real pattern extraction.

### Friday (2026-02-06)

-   [ ] **Pattern & Workflow Consolidation**
    -   [ ] Continue extracting and wiring patterns into the dev site as needed.
    -   [ ] Clean up and organise extracted patterns (naming, folders, documentation).
-   [ ] **Testing & Review**
    -   [ ] Do a pass over the dev site to test key patterns and flows.
    -   [ ] Document any remaining gaps or follow-ups for next week (e.g., patterns not yet extracted, Agent improvements, design system tweaks).
-   [ ] **Wrap-Up**
    -   [ ] Review the week’s deliverables against the Weekly Goals.
    -   [ ] Update logs with what worked well, what was difficult, and what you want to try next.
    -   [ ] Prepare notes for the next phase of work (e.g., more robust tokens, more automation, additional pages).

## Commitment

This week, I commit to completing the following for sure:

-   Starting and iterating on at least one Agent skill that supports Figma → JSON/pattern extraction.
-   Finishing collection of the remaining Sixcats components and patterns with variables applied.
-   Setting up the MCP/integration and a Sixcats dev server, and successfully extracting at least one pattern from Figma into working WordPress code.

## Success Metrics

-   **Agent Skills**: At least one Agent skill running end-to-end on a small, real example (e.g., extracting a pattern or helpful data from Figma).
-   **Component & Pattern Collection**: Remaining components and patterns collected and organised, with variables correctly assigned.
-   **MCP/Integration**: MCP (or equivalent) configured and able to retrieve pattern-related data from Figma.
-   **Dev Server Setup**: Sixcats dev site running locally with the theme active.
-   **Pattern Extraction to Code**: At least one Figma pattern successfully translated into a WordPress pattern and tested on the dev site.
-   **Documentation & Logging**: Issues, edge cases, and workflow notes clearly logged for future improvement.

## Learning Goals

-   **Agent & MCP Workflows**: Learn how to design and implement practical Agent skills that integrate with Figma and your code workflow.
-   **Design to Code Automation**: Deepen understanding of how to move from Figma structure (components, frames, tokens) into WordPress patterns and templates.
-   **Dev Environment Confidence**: Get more comfortable setting up and using a dedicated dev WordPress environment for iterative pattern testing.

## Technical Skills Focus

-   **Agent / MCP Implementation**: Prompting, skill design, and data extraction from Figma.
-   **Pattern Extraction & Mapping**: Converting Figma patterns into semantic, reusable WordPress block patterns.
-   **Theme & Dev Setup**: Running and maintaining a WordPress dev site for Sixcats.
-   **Debugging & Logging**: Systematically tracking issues during automation and design-to-code conversion.

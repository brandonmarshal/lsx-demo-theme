# Week 22 Planning (2026-02-09 to 2026-02-13)

## Weekly Goals

-   [ ] **Goal 1**: Finalize and validate the `theme.json` using variables extracted from the Figma Design File.
-   [ ] **Goal 2**: Begin and make significant progress on extracting and building patterns, using the completed `theme.json` as the foundation.
-   [ ] **Goal 3**: Maintain a daily 1-hour study session focused on relevant topics (design systems, Figma, WordPress, automation, etc.).
-   [ ] **Goal 4**: Update planning and tasks as new requirements or blockers arise.

-   [ ] **Pattern Extraction & Refinement**
    -   [ ] Continue building and refining patterns.
    -   [ ] Test patterns in the dev environment to ensure correct rendering and variable usage.
    -   [ ] Adjust `theme.json` or pattern code as needed based on testing.
-   [ ] **Study Session**
    -   [ ] 1 hour of focused study.

### Friday (2026-02-13)

-   [ ] **Pattern Completion & Review**
    -   [ ] Complete initial set of patterns.
    -   [ ] Review and document any remaining patterns to be built or improved.
    -   [ ] Update planning with any new tasks or follow-ups for next week.
-   [ ] **Study Session**
    -   [ ] 1 hour of focused study.
-   [ ] **Wrap-Up**

    -   [ ] Update logs with what worked well, what was difficult, and what you want to try next.
    -   [ ] Prepare notes for the next phase of work (e.g., advanced automation, additional pattern types, further design system improvements).

## Commitment

This week, I commit to:

-   Finalizing a complete and accurate `theme.json` from Figma variables.
-   Starting and making significant progress on pattern extraction and creation.
-   Maintaining a daily 1-hour study session.
-   Updating planning as new tasks or blockers arise.

## Success Metrics

-   **Theme.json**: 100% of required variables extracted and validated from Figma, with a working `theme.json` in the project.
-   **Pattern Extraction**: Initial set of patterns built and tested using the finalized `theme.json`.
-   **Study Sessions**: 1 hour of study completed and logged each day.
-   **Documentation & Logging**: Issues, learnings, and workflow notes clearly logged for future improvement.

## Learning Goals

-   **Theme.json Mastery**: Deepen understanding of mapping Figma variables to WordPress theme.json structure.
-   **Pattern Workflow**: Improve skills in extracting, building, and testing patterns based on a design system.
-   **Continuous Learning**: Build a habit of daily study and reflection to support ongoing growth.

## Technical Skills Focus

-   **Theme.json Extraction & Validation**: Automating and verifying the mapping from Figma to WordPress.
-   **Pattern Creation**: Translating design patterns into semantic, reusable WordPress block patterns.
-   **Testing & Debugging**: Ensuring patterns and theme.json work as expected in the dev environment.
-   **Documentation & Planning**: Keeping plans and logs up to date as the project evolves.

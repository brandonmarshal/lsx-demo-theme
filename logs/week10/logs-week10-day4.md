### How do you feel about today's progress?

Today was productive with a good mix of study, meetings, and development. The gallery feature and template integration tasks went smoothly, and Copilot's reviews helped refine the work. The Block Editor tutorial is now complete, and feedback has been provided. Some workflow automation did not work as expected, so I will handle labels manually tomorrow.

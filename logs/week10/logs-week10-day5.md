### How do you feel about today's progress?

Today's work did not fully go to plan since I hit the premium request limit on Copilot, preventing completion of my last 4 issues. Nevertheless, made good progress on mobile menu changes and plugin release tasks, and synced project labels successfully after troubleshooting the workflow.

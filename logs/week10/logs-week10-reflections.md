# Week 10 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses Completed

#### WordPress Block Editor Study & Tutorials

-   [x] Block Editor structured study (2.0 hrs)
-   [x] Block Editor Getting Started tutorials, glossary, how-to guides and feedback sessions (4.0 hrs)
-   [x] Prompting research for Docker-based local WP dev environment (1.0 hr)
-   [x] Technical research (Google Maps API integration, Plugin dependency management) (2.0 hrs)

**Total Learning Time:** 9.0 hrs completed

### What went well?

This week was highly productive, with steady progress across development, research, and workflow tasks. Major technical accomplishments included the implementation and completion of multiple GitHub issues: plugin dependency management, custom post types migration, Google Maps integration, repeatable group fields, block editor custom blocks, multi-block plugin architecture, gallery and template pattern integration, and full theme rebranding. Each day reflected diligent planning, hands-on coding, and meaningful collaboration with Copilot for both technical tasks and feedback cycles. Workflow enhancements included successful project label syncing, milestone creation and refinement, and the first plugin release—with up-to-date documentation and changelogs. The Block Editor study and Docker environment research deepened practical understanding of WordPress block architecture and local development patterns. Consistent referencing of organization best practices and agent instructions maintained code quality, documentation standards, and accessibility.

### What can be improved?

Workflow automation for label syncing did not work as expected, requiring manual intervention; exploring more robust automation will save time on project administration. Copilot’s premium request limit was hit near the end of the week, pausing completion of several premium tasks—better pacing and anticipatory prioritization would mitigate disruption going forward. Mid-week, some tasks took longer than planned due to iterative prompting (e.g., shaping clear, concise issue content), highlighting need for reusable issue templates or Copilot scripts. Scheduling was occasionally over-ambitious (too many study topics in a single day); a more balanced distribution of research and development across the week would improve focus and retention. Health concerns (headache) delayed some planned studies—continued attention to sustainable pace is needed. Logging consistency improved but could be made even more systematic using Ash’s strategy.

### What have you learned?

Gained practical experience with advanced Block Editor concepts: file structure, block.json configuration, dual PHP/JS registration, wrapper utilities, HTML comment storage, static/dynamic rendering, and build tooling. Docker-based WordPress workflows became clearer through official image review and planning for docker-compose setups. Implementing and reviewing multiple plugin features and integrations under Copilot’s guidance reinforced collaborative coding and best practices, including security, documentation, and accessibility. Developed a sharper eye for milestone planning, release management, and documentation accuracy. Learned the importance of pacing and adjusting plans based on day-to-day realities and health. Experienced firsthand how refining GitHub issues through prompting leads to actionable, standards-aligned tasks and lays groundwork for strong implementation. Finally, learned to proactively address workflow and automation edge-cases and maintain momentum in the face of external limits (premium requests, health, admin hurdles).

### What are your next actions?

-   Prioritize completion of the four outstanding premium issues in the v0.2 Beta milestone once Copilot limits reset.
-   Prototype the planned docker-compose local environment for rapid WordPress/theme iteration and document the process for future devs.
-   Systematize logging and issue creation using reusable scripts/templates based on Ash’s recommendations and organizational instructions.
-   Continue iterating on Mobile/Mega menu design, focusing on fullscreen implementation and accessibility.
-   Review automation workflows for project labels and milestone management, aiming for reliable, low-touch solutions.
-   Apply Block Editor knowledge by creating both static and dynamic custom blocks as planned.
-   Maintain thorough, standards-compliant documentation and changelogs for all plugin releases and updates.
-   Distribute study topics more evenly throughout future weeks to optimize focus and reduce context switching.
-   Leverage organization Copilot instructions to keep all coding aligned with LightSpeed standards (accessibility, security, modularity, testing).
-   Sustain regular communication and feedback loops with Ash, Seren, and the wider team, keeping planning and implementation tightly integrated.

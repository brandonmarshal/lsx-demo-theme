# Week 11, Day 1 Log 2025-11-10

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Monitored status of Github premium support ticket; no update received, blocking related issue work.
-   Attempted to continue learning with the Ollie Block theme, but the Ollie website was unavailable, preventing access to documentation and resources.
-   Shifted focus to mobile menu and mega menu development; worked on implementing fullscreen mobile menu, researched solutions using CSS and SCSS, and sought AI assistance for best practices.
-   Created and began BrowserStack learning and testing task; reviewed documentation and posted an update on current understanding and areas needing improvement.
-   Updated weekly planning to reschedule incomplete tasks and ensure coverage for the remainder of the week.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

Today was not very productive. Progress was blocked by external factors (Github support delay, Ollie site outage), and I struggled to follow my planned schedule. I need to improve focus and adherence to my daily plan to avoid getting lost between tasks. I will prepare better for tomorrow.

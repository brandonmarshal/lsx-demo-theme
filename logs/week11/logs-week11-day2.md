## Notes

-   I appreciate the feedback from Ash, it points me in the right direction and I can see things I am doing wrong and need to improve on.
-   It took me some time to do this, there are some settings on the site editor that I am still not 100% sure how to use, I consistently learn better understanding of the settings as I use them and practice on my site. Prompting with AI also really helps.

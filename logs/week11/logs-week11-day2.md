## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Had a feedback meeting with Ash this morning, I now have a lot of tasks to work on and improvements to make to my site.

-   Revamped my single-fish template, it is looking a lot better - PR: [#112]([url](https://github.com/brandonmarshal/lsx-demo-theme/pull/112))
-   Revamped my "Fish Species" page to use the entire page width, and changed the post card.

## Notes

-   I appreciate the feedback from Ash, it points me in the right direction and I can see things I am doing wrong and need to improve on.
-   It took me some time to do this, there are some settings on the site editor that I am still not 100% sure how to use, I consistently learn better understanding of the settings as I use them and practice on my site. Prompting with AI also really helps.
-   These changes I have made on the site are all on the local still, I need to still push the last 2 changes to Github Development branch.

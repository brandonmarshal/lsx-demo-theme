## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Short catchup with Ash
-   I changed the style of my website from the Dark brown and light brown, to my dark green and white style.
-   I used accessibility checker to test the colour combination and it passes.
-   I have edited my header and footer templates as well.
-   I got AI to create me a lighter variant of my logo for dark backgrounds

## Notes

-   I appreciate the feedback from Ash, it points me in the right direction and I can see things I am doing wrong and need to improve on.
-   It took me some time to do this, there are some settings on the site editor that I am still not 100% sure how to use, I consistently learn better understanding of the settings as I use them and practice on my site. Prompting with AI also really helps.
-   These changes I have made on the site are all on the local still, I need to still push the last 2 changes to Github Development branch.

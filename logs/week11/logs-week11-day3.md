## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Short catchup with Ash
-   I changed the style of my website from the Dark brown and light brown, to my dark green and white style.
-   I used accessibility checker to test the colour combination and it passes.
-   I have edited my header and footer templates as well.
-   I got AI to create me a lighter variant of my logo for dark backgrounds
-   I have been fixing some templates that had errors, such as 404, archive-all, search results, page-no-title
-   Added all pages to Navigation and adjusted global theme colours for better accessibility.
-   Started working on the about page and will continue further after lunch.

## Notes

-   I am liking the new colour scheme a lot more, luckily it was already a style that existed in my theme, it just needed slight adjustments.
-   As I continue to edit templates that need fixing I will adjust colour where needed.

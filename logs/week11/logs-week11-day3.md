## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Short catchup with Ash
-   I changed the style of my website from the Dark brown and light brown, to my dark green and white style.
-   I used accessibility checker to test the colour combination and it passes.
-   I have edited my header and footer templates as well.
-   I got AI to create me a lighter variant of my logo for dark backgrounds
-   I have been fixing some templates that had errors, such as 404, archive-all, search results, page-no-title
-   Added all pages to Navigation and adjusted global theme colours for better accessibility.
-   Started working on the about page and will continue further after lunch.
-   Attempted to make my mega menu to not be fullscreen, but have not been successful as of yet. 
-   Opened a PR to sync my repo with lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme. I need to resolve the conflicts first. I will look into that tomorrow. 
-   Exported changes via "Create block theme" and created a PR to merge them into my develop branch.
-   I did some research with AI regarding webpack and to build instructions for a Github Issue to setup webpack.
-   I got copilot to read through my repo before setting up instructions, in order to get more accurate setup instructions.
-   I have created the ISSUE and will start with it tomorrow morning - https://github.com/brandonmarshal/lsx-demo-theme/issues/115

## Notes

-   I am liking the new colour scheme a lot more, luckily it was already a style that existed in my theme, it just needed slight adjustments.
-   As I continue to edit templates that need fixing I will adjust colour where needed.
-   I am struggling slightly to keep track of all my tasks, I feel like there are so many, I need to improve my task management in Asana.

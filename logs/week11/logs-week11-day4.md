## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have spent time to organise my asana tasks as they were a mess.
-   I added tags, projects and grouped all my tasks for better navigation and tracking.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – Going through tasks and assigning tags and projects, also grouping all tasks.

## Notes

-   This management of adding tags and projects to tasks is really helpful, the colours actually help my brain automatically organise things. I will try to be consistent with this tagging.

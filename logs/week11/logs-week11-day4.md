## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have spent time to organise my asana tasks as they were a mess.
-   I added tags, projects and grouped all my tasks for better navigation and tracking.
-   Tried to fix the conflicts on my PR to sync my REPO with the UPSTREAM but I am struggling as I need to resolve them with the command line instead of in the Web Editor. - #114

### How do you feel about today's progress?

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – Going through tasks and assigning tags and projects, also grouping all tasks.
-   1.75 hrs - Trying to resolve the merge conflicts on my SYNC Pull Request. 

---

## Notes

-   This management of adding tags and projects to tasks is really helpful, the colours actually help my brain automatically organise things. I will try to be consistent with this tagging.
-   I am moving on from this task for now, as the day is going on and I am making no progress. I do not want to waste my time struggling, I will rather see later tonight or set time tomorrow to learn how to resolve conflicts via the command line.

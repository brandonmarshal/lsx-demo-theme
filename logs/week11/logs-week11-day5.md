## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed my 2 hour study session for today.

### What I learnt

-   Keyword research. - It helps you understand exactly what your audience is searching for, so you can create content that matches their intent.
-   Copywriting - Strong, clear copy keeps visitors engaged and encourages them to take action.
-   Site structure - A well organised site structure makes it easier for search engines to crawl your pages and helps users navigate smoothly, improving overall SEO performance.
-   Making content that ranks. - High-quality, helpful content signals expertise and value to both users and search engines
-   I have been reading up on FacetWP to understand how to implement it in my site - https://facetwp.com/help-center/using-facetwp-with/blocks/
-   I got FacetWP installed, I just need to understand how to use it in the editor.
-   Installed Yoast plugin as well and navigated through that for a bit to test different features that are free.
-   General updates to my site like
-   adding padding in certain areas
-   changing designs of some images
-   adjusting text colours and link colour where they are needed for better accessibility.
-   My colour scheme for some reason reset, so I had to go back and apply previous revisions to recover as much as possible, I had to re-do my single-fish again as well as edit my gear and fish species page templates.
-   I also looked through some of the suggested fixes from my Yoast plugin and that is giving me some good insight to where I need to improve my site.
-   Had a short catchup with Barbs.
-   I am still going through and learning how to properly use the Yoast SEO, but there is a course they offer that I will definitely do to get a full understanding.

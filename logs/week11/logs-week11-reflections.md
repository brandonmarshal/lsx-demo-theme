# Week 11 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Continued learning and troubleshooting with the Ollie Block theme, though progress was blocked by site outages and lack of documentation access.
-   Focused on mobile menu and mega menu development, including fullscreen and non-fullscreen variants, with research into CSS/SCSS best practices and accessibility.
-   Completed a feedback meeting with Ash, resulting in a clear set of actionable improvements and tasks for the site.
-   Revamped the single-fish template and Fish Species page for improved layout and accessibility; created a new mega menu for fish species.
-   Updated header, footer, and global theme colours for better accessibility, including use of accessibility checkers and colour contrast tools.
-   Fixed errors in multiple templates (404, archive-all, search results, page-no-title) and ensured all pages were added to navigation.
-   Began work on the About page and improved image assets, including creating a lighter logo variant for dark backgrounds.
-   Managed merge conflicts and repository sync with upstream, learning to resolve conflicts via the command line.
-   Started and completed sections of the Yoast "SEO For Beginners" course, learning about holistic SEO, keyword research, copywriting, site structure, and content ranking.
-   Installed and explored FacetWP and Yoast plugins, applying suggested fixes and learning to use new features for SEO and filtering.
-   Improved site design, padding, image styles, and text/link colours for accessibility; recovered from a colour scheme reset by reapplying previous revisions.
-   Enhanced task management in Asana by adding tags, projects, and grouping tasks for better tracking and navigation.
-   Engaged in regular catchups with Ash and Barbs for feedback and support.

**Total Learning & Development Time:** ~17.5 hrs (across technical, design, SEO, and workflow tasks)

### What went well?

-   Feedback from Ash provided clear direction and actionable improvements, leading to visible progress in site design and structure.
-   Revamped templates and navigation improved both accessibility and user experience.
-   Systematic task management in Asana increased clarity and focus, making it easier to track and prioritize work.
-   SEO study and plugin exploration (Yoast, FacetWP) deepened understanding of search optimization and site structure.
-   Regular use of accessibility tools and colour contrast checks ensured compliance and improved site usability.
-   Collaboration and prompting with AI accelerated troubleshooting and learning, especially for technical blockers and design challenges.

### What can be improved?

-   External blockers (Github support delays, Ollie site outage) disrupted planned learning and issue work; need to build contingency plans for such events.
-   Merge conflict resolution via command line was challenging; further practice and documentation will help streamline future syncs.
-   Task management was initially scattered; ongoing use of tags, projects, and grouping in Asana should be maintained for consistency.
-   Colour scheme resets and unsaved changes caused rework; more frequent saves and version control can help prevent loss of progress.
-   Still learning to use some site editor settings and plugin features; continued practice and study needed.
-   Need to push local changes to Github more consistently to keep branches up to date.

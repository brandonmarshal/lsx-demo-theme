## Notes

-   I am starting to understand the dependencies more clearly and how they work.
-   I can definitely learn a lot more about these dependencies and how they all work together for better site performance.
-   I need to refactor my planning for this week.
-   I feel this practical experience of implementing webpack has really helped me understand the process, but I will definitely still need to read more of the provided docs to understand.
-   I should have used SCF a lot sooner to create my taxonomies, lesson learnt and I will fix it.

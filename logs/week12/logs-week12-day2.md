## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have created and reviews my PR for Webpack implementation.
-   Moved Fish CPT as well as the Taxonomies to Secure Custom Fields
-   I have now updated the Gear CPT and the Area CPT as well as their taxonomies and fields to Secure custom fields.
-   I have got a FacetWP filter built and filtering my Fish Species. 

## Time Logs

-   0.75 hrs – Creating PR and Reviewing it with Copilot
-   2.0 hrs - Creating Fish CPT & taxonomies in SCF, then removing old fish-cpt.php
-   0.5 hrs - I have now updated the Gear CPT and the Area CPT as well as their taxonomies and fields to Secure custom fields.
-   2.5 hrs - I have spent a lot of time setting up my Fish Species Facet and trouble shooting.

## Notes

-   The fish CPT took longer than I thought it would, I also saw some improvement to be made, like making the fields more reusable where they can be.
-   The FacetWP is not as easy as it seems, I need to read more about this and the docs on FacetWP official site.

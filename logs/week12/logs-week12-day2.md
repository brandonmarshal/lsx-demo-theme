## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have created and reviews my PR for Webpack implementation.
-   Moved Fish CPT as well as the Taxonomies to Secure Custom Fields

## Time Logs

-   0.75 hrs – Creating PR and Reviewing it with Copilot
-   2.0 hrs - Creating Fish CPT & taxonomies in SCF, then removing old fish-cpt.php

---

## Notes

-   The fish CPT took longer than I thought it would, I also saw some improvement to be made, like making the fields more reusable where they can be.

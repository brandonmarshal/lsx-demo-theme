# Week 12, Day 3 Log 2025-11-19

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have done some troubleshooting with Ai to help me figure out my FacetWP error.
-   The filter is designed archive templates.
-   I created a new Species Archive template to test the facetwp filter
-   I have ran into a problem with FacetWP and SCF working together and required more troubleshooting (still not working)
-   I moved on to the Namespacing ISSUE for my plugin. Copilot is reviewing and suggesting where the namespacing needs to be unified.
-   I have refactored my plugin to unify namespacing among ALL the files in my plugin.
-   I had to do some auditing on packages that had ISSUES. 
-   I have tested the npm build and it runs successfully. Now for other testing.

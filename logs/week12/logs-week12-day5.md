## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have continued testing my plugin for some last enhancements today before the release tag.
-   Had to fix "Edit" and "Delete" options as they were not showing on the CPT's
-   Quick facts custom field was not taking any text or input at all, so I have fixed that and you can now insert text.
-   I have been working now with SCSS for the single-fish post template but I am having some issues.
-   Did some troubleshooting with copilot for a while but was unable to fix the problem.
-  Generated wireframes for my plugins single-fish template, which is currently bugged.
-  Completed my reflections for the weeks and create planning for next week.

-   Researched and installed FacetWP plugin, built filters for Fish Species, and troubleshooted integration with SCF.
-   Moved all CPTs (Fish, Gear, Area) and taxonomies from ACF to Secure Custom Fields (SCF) for better security and reusability.
-   Refactored plugin to unify namespacing across all files, merged PR after testing.
-   Set up WordPress Beta Tester to explore WP 6.9 RC1 features and improvements.
-   Conducted thorough plugin testing: installation/activation, CPTs, taxonomies, custom fields; fixed issues like Edit/Delete options and Quick facts input.
-   Created Species Archive template with query loop and post cards for FacetWP testing.
-   Audited and fixed package vulnerabilities, updated chatmode files based on code reviews.
-   Planned and had catchup meeting with Ash, refactored weekly planning to include discussed tasks.
-   Updated Asana projects: closed completed tasks, updated status, noted missing briefs/wireframes.
-   Copied block patterns from ai-block-theme for reuse.
-   Worked on SCSS for single-fish template, troubleshooting with Copilot.

**Total Learning & Development Time:** ~38 hrs (across technical implementation, testing, SEO learning, plugin development, and project management)

### What went well?

-   Successful Webpack implementation and testing, including PR creation and review.
-   Completed SEO course and applied learnings to site planning.
-   Moved to SCF for better security and reusability, registering all CPTs and taxonomies properly.
-   Unified plugin namespacing and resolved HTTP 500 errors through systematic testing.
-   Thorough plugin testing identified and fixed multiple issues (Edit/Delete, custom fields).
-   Effective use of AI (Copilot) for troubleshooting FacetWP, SCSS, and code reviews.
-   Improved project management in Asana with task closures and status updates.
-   Explored WP 6.9 features via beta testing, staying current with WordPress developments.

### What can be improved?

-   Earlier and more frequent testing throughout development to avoid accumulating issues (e.g., HTTP 500, ACF/SCF conflicts).
-   Better documentation and planning for plugin dependencies and integrations (FacetWP + SCF).
-   More consistent pushing of local changes to Github to maintain branch sync.
-   Deeper research into FacetWP documentation before implementation to reduce troubleshooting time.

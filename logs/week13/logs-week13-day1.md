## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have started the course "Building a 4-page business Website" https://app.asana.com/1/1152726221312/project/1211170302971594/task/1211693001586023?focus=true
-   Updated changelogs and used that and my commits to draft a release tag.
-   Closed off the milestones and moved incomplete tasks over to the next milestone.
-   Did prompt research and planning for a different approach to the plugin.
-   After merging develop branch into main, I had some issues with my CPT's as copilot had deleted them and I never noticed.
-   I have managed to get backups and to get them functional again, this was important because without those CPT's my pages cannot work. 

### How do you feel about today's progress?

## Notes

- I feel like my plugin is started to get messy for no reason, so today I have done some prompt research with AI asking questions about essential folders/files for a wordpress plugin. Based off that I was able to feed it more information regarding my site and my goals.
- My CPT's were removed by Copilot because it was the theme and plugin conflicting with each other as they had the same CPT's. So I had to restore them but they were not working on my staging site, I saw now menus in the admin panel etc.

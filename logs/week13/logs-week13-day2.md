## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed my course "Creating 4-page business website"
-   New course starting tomorrow - https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/user-management/
-   Created ALL the Field groups, CPT's, Taxonomies and Custom Fields.
-   Exported Via JSON and installed secure-custom-fields vendor in my plugin
-   Vendor is meant to look at the exported JSON to create the same content for every user that activates my plugin, but I am experiencing some duplication error.
-   Fixed the duplication error
-   All custom fields created in SCF now import correctly and only appear once the plugin is activated.
-   Setup a planning on ChatGPT for content for my CPT's to apply custom fields data as well.
-   Cleared all CPT funcionality from my theme so it can run purely from my plugin but I am having problems with the database.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

## Notes

-   I really like the course "Creating 4-page business website". It showed me a lot of approaches to research and page creation and editing.
-   My plugin is currently creating duplicates of the Fields and CPT's so I need to get that fixed so I can move on.

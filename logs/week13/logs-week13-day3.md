## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I started a new wordpress course - https://app.asana.com/1/1152726221312/project/1211170302971594/task/1212083957597797
-   Now that CPT's work correctly I can setup my content correctly as well, so I have been working on content for my site.
-   Designed a new template for 404 error.
-   Adding more custom fields to my posts via my plugin.
-   Ran into a problem with my Wordpress DB, it was conflicting with what my plugin was trying to import because the names were the same. So I had to attempt to clear the database of all CPT's and Taxonomies.
-   Had a catchup meeting with Ash, we discussed my progress so far with my plugin and my website. He also shared some really useful wordpress lesson for me to improve my knowledge. 

### How do you feel about today's progress?

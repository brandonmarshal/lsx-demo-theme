## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have attended a Woo Commerce Workshop
-   Custom fields did not want to load via shortcode there was a permissions block, I fixed that in my plugin and now the custom fields can be used via shortcode
-   The shortcode cannot be styled, so I am building a template part for each CPT and their custom fields I can use.
-   so far I have edited content on the following tabs
-   Daily Logs
-   Weekly plan
-   Evaluation & Mentorship
-   Completed the Internship Admin tab as well as its sub tabs.
-   Attended Developer updates, Wordpress 6.9 Workshop

## How do you feel about today's progress?
### Notes
-  Today has been really productive. I manage to join a workshop this morning at 4am and it was quite interesting. I learnt how to navigate through Woo-commerce plugin and what the settings do etc.
-  I am quite happy with my progress on my plugin, it is taking me a while to get a single-fish template that actually work with all my custom fields, but I am going to keep trying.
-  I had to put the template building aside for a bit today, so I could focus on the intern document improvements.

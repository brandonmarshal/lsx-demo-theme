## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have attended a Woo Commerce Workshop
-   Custom fields did not want to load via shortcode there was a permissions block, I fixed that in my plugin and now the custom fields can be used via shortcode
-   The shortcode cannot be styled, so I am building a template part for each CPT and their custom fields I can use.
-   so far I have edited content on the following tabs
-   Daily Logs
-   Weekly plan
-   Evaluation & Mentorship

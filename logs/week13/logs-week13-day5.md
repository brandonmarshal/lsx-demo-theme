-   Had a catchup meeting with Ash
-   We discussed the internship google doc and how we want to approach the plan
-   We decided that it will be better to create a more guided curriculum, showing the interns EXACTLY what is important for each Month.

## How do you feel about today's progress?
### Notes
-  I am doing the Advanced Wordpress User course. I am so far enjoying the course and it is helping me understand a lot more about Wordpress.
-  My meeting with Ash went well, he explained to me his idea for the interns doc and I understand what he wants. The documents could definitely use some touch ups to better guide the interns from day 1.

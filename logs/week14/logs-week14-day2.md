# Week 14, Day 2 Log 2025-12-1

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed the last tabs on the google doc
-   I have added them to Lightspeeds LSX-DEMO-THEME repo as well, PR waiting for review.
-   I sent an email to Ingrid letting her know the document is complete.
-   The files I uploaded to gituhb did not include the links, so I had to go back and add in the links via vscode with copilot
-   Catchup with Ash, regarding PR templates, keep a changelog and semantic versioning. 


## Time Logs

-   3.5 hrs – Working and completing the intern document and creating PR for Github merging of the docs as well.
-   0.5 hrs - Catchup with Ash
-   1.5 hrs - Reviewed the PR and had to add links in.

## Notes

- The document in my opinion, is looking good. I have dedicated a lot of time towards this document which has slowed down my plugin and site quite a lot.
- I will create a plan today for my remainding time until closing time, then that plan should get me closer to being completed.

# Week 14, Day 2 Log 2025-12-1

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed the last tabs on the google doc
-   I have added them to Lightspeeds LSX-DEMO-THEME repo as well, PR waiting for review.
-   I sent an email to Ingrid letting her know the document is complete.
-   The files I uploaded to gituhb did not include the links, so I had to go back and add in the links via vscode with copilot
-   Catchup with Ash, regarding PR templates, keep a changelog and semantic versioning.
-   I have manage to go through all the revisions by Copilot and Coderabbit and fix and improve with their suggestions.
-   All links are now back in the files
-   Changelog has been updated.
-   Last thing I need to do before merging:
    -   Add the usage of PR template in the Github skills section for new interns to learn they need to use PR templates when creating PR's
 
-   I have create my planning from 3 Dec - 17 Dec which gives me two more days to make any changes afterwards.

## Notes

- The document in my opinion, is looking good. I have dedicated a lot of time towards this document which has slowed down my plugin and site quite a lot.
- I will create a plan today for my remainding time until closing time, then that plan should get me closer to being completed.

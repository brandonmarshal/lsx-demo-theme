# Week 14, Day 3 Log 2025-12-3

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have implemented the awesome-copilot and lightspeedwp .github repositories into the intern documentation.
-   Audited my exisitng plugin vs the scope to get exactly what needs to be implemented still.
-   The plugin is fully aligned with "Area" naming for CPT, taxonomies, meta keys, and templates.
-   No legacy "Story" references remain; no rename work is needed.
-   I have audited my theme again to ensure a full theme rebrand, some files still needed changing, I have made those edits
-   My theme is now fully rebranded.
-   I have been working on my google maps integration - https://github.com/brandonmarshal/lsx-demo-theme/issues/125
-   Settings page is looking good and it validates the API key aswell, super awesome.
-   My blocks dont seem to be working. I am still troubleshooting and trying to figure out the problem.

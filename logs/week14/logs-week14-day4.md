# Week 14, Day 4 Log 2025-12-4

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have gathered the relevant information from my plugin to use in the plugin scaffold template
-   I started to replace the values with copilot but realised this was the wrong approach so now I am starting it over.
-   Read through the repo to get a better understanding of how to use the scaffold template
-   I have entered all my details in the terminal prompt to generate my plugin with the scaffold.
-   npm installed worked fine, installing composer errored out. I will troubleshoot this.
-   I have made some changes to my plugin settings page
-   changed how it works with SCF. No longer using vendor in the plugin you actually need to install it now
-   Read through a little bit on the Plugin Handbook to help me learn more about plugins - https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/
-   Had a short meeting with Ash regarding the "block-theme-scaffold" and "multi-block-plugin-scaffold". 


## Time Logs

-   1.5 hrs – Gathering CPT's, taxonomies, custom fields etc from my plugin to use in scaffold.
-   1.0 hrs - Attempting to merge my content into the scaffold but used the wrong approach.
-   1.0 hrs - Read through the repo to get a better understanding of how to use the scaffold template and now setup a fresh repo to try again.
-   1.5 hrs - Created my own JSON from my existing plugin data, but it errored. Now I manually went through the terminal prompt inserting my answers
-   2.5 hrs - Reading through some plugin handbook and then making changes to my original plugin
-   1.0 hrs - Had a meeting with Ash

## Notes

- The meeting with Ash was really helpful. Being able to see how he goes about using the template/scaffold really help me understand as well.
- It helps me to watch people do something then I can understand why and how.

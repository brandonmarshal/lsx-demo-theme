## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have gathered the relevant information from my plugin to use in the plugin scaffold template
-   I started to replace the values with copilot but realised this was the wrong approach so now I am starting it over.


## Time Logs

-   1.5 hrs – Gathering CPT's, taxonomies, custom fields etc from my plugin to use in scaffold.
-   1.0 hrs - Attempting to merge my content into the scaffold but used the wrong approach.

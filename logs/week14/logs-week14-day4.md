# Week 14, Day 4 Log 2025-12-4

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have gathered the relevant information from my plugin to use in the plugin scaffold template
-   I started to replace the values with copilot but realised this was the wrong approach so now I am starting it over.
-   Read through the repo to get a better understanding of how to use the scaffold template
-   I have entered all my details in the terminal prompt to generate my plugin with the scaffold.
-   npm installed worked fine, installing composer errored out. I will troubleshoot this. 


## Time Logs

-   1.5 hrs – Gathering CPT's, taxonomies, custom fields etc from my plugin to use in scaffold.
-   1.0 hrs - Attempting to merge my content into the scaffold but used the wrong approach.
-   1.0 hrs - Read through the repo to get a better understanding of how to use the scaffold template and now setup a fresh repo to try again.
-   1.5 hrs - Created my own JSON from my existing plugin data, but it errored. Now I manually went through the terminal prompt inserting my answers

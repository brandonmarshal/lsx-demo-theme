# Week 14, Day 5 Log 2025-12-5

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I found some extra lessons to add the intern doc
-   I watched the videos in those lessons to understand plugins more.
-   I have made some updates on my plugin:
    -   Added SCSS to settings page for better visuals
    -   API keys now get validated after saving with success/error message (tested and works)
    -   Setup WP-scripts to compile my SCSS for me. 


## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Finding plugin lessons and completing them. Also read through relevant section in the plugin handbook.
-   1.5 hrs - Working on my original plugin and make adjustments as mentioned above. Tested and working.

## Notes

- I am really enjoying the plugin development, it can get frustrating when things dont work that I thought were simple, but once it does work 
there is no better feeling.

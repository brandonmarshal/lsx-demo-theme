# Week 14, Day 5 Log 2025-12-5

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I found some extra lessons to add the intern doc
-   I watched the videos in those lessons to understand plugins more.
-   I have made some updates on my plugin:
    -   Added SCSS to settings page for better visuals
    -   API keys now get validated after saving with success/error message (tested and works)
    -   Setup WP-scripts to compile my SCSS for me.
 
-   Created a CHANGELOG tab in the intern doc and informed Ingrid of its use.
-   I have worked on my plugin and made good progress, the google maps blocks is now registering.
-   I now am trying to get the block to acknowledge my API key so it can actually show locations. 


## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Finding plugin lessons and completing them. Also read through relevant section in the plugin handbook.
-   1.5 hrs - Working on my original plugin and make adjustments as mentioned above. Tested and working.
-   1.0 hrs - troubleshooting my google maps block on my plugin, it does not want to register on wordpress

-   3.0 hrs - Working on my plugin, google maps integration.

## Notes

- I am really enjoying the plugin development, it can get frustrating when things dont work that I thought were simple, but once it does work 
there is no better feeling.

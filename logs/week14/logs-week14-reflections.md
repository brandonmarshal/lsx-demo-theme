# Week 14 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Completed additional plugin development lessons and watched relevant videos on plugin handbook sections.
-   Participated in catchup meetings with Ash to discuss internship document approach, PR templates, changelog management, and semantic versioning.
-   Studied plugin scaffold usage and template integration through hands-on troubleshooting and documentation review.
-   Worked on Google Maps integration in plugin, including API key validation and block registration.
-   Updated internship document with guided curriculum details, admin sections, and CHANGELOG tab.
-   Used Awesome Copilot and CodeRabbit for document updates and code reviews.

**Total Learning & Development Time:** ~25 hrs (across document improvements, plugin development, meetings, and troubleshooting)

### What went well?

-   Successfully completed and updated all major tabs in the internship document, including adding links, descriptions, and a CHANGELOG section.
-   Made significant progress on plugin development, including SCSS styling, API key validation, and Google Maps block registration.
-   Effective collaboration with Ash through meetings and Fireflies recordings for planning and troubleshooting.
-   Leveraged AI tools (Awesome Copilot, CodeRabbit) for efficient code fixes and document updates.
-   Maintained consistent daily progress despite troubleshooting challenges.

### What can be improved?

-   Earlier systematic testing of plugin components to reduce troubleshooting time and bug accumulation.
-   Better time allocation between document work and plugin development to avoid context switching.
-   More proactive documentation of meeting notes and changes for team accessibility.
-   Enhanced focus on testing plugin functionality before implementation to prevent registration issues.

### What have you learned?

-   Document management strategies, including tab organization, guided curricula, and CHANGELOG maintenance.
-   Effective use of AI tools for code reviews and document updates.
-   Meeting facilitation and planning refinements using Fireflies for collaborative discussions.

### What are your next actions?

-   Finalize Google Maps block functionality to display locations using API keys.
-   Complete outstanding plugin bugs and ensure all custom fields integrate properly.
-   Deploy updated internship documents for team review and feedback.
-   Schedule follow-up meetings to refine curriculum and plugin based on testing.
-   Continue daily study sessions while balancing development tasks.
-   Document lessons from plugin development and scaffold usage for future reference.
-   Prepare for final internship deliverables and program transition.

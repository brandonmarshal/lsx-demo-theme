## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Finalised my google maps block is reading the API key and the long and lat custom fields on Area CPT.
-   Fish-card block in my plugin was not working and not getting correct custom fields. I have worked through all the problems and I am happy with the result

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Finalised google maps integration. Tests complete.
-   2.0 hrs - Working on the other 4 blocks in my plugin.
-   2.0 hrs - Working on fish-card, now happy with the result

## Notes

-   The google maps integrations caused me many gray hairs. The biggest struggle I had was getting the actual block for the map to register in Wordpress, I had setup my multi block plugin incorrectly. Then getting the block to read the API key that is saved and validated in the settings page.

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs - Working on fish-card, now happy with the result
-   2.5 hrs - Created ALL single-post templates with great SCSS styling and drafted a plan for creating query loop block to display more posts.
-   1.0 hrs - Troubleshooting my card-blcoks

## Notes

-   The google maps integrations caused me many gray hairs. The biggest struggle I had was getting the actual block for the map to register in Wordpress, I had setup my multi block plugin incorrectly. Then getting the block to read the API key that is saved and validated in the settings page.
-   The single post blocks look very nice but I need the query loop block as I intend to have more posts for it. But the single post block is very good to use within the query loop block.
-   I cannot get the unique cards to work on other pages. The fish-card only works on a fish post, it does not work on any other page. I am trying to figure out why this is happening, I still have not figured it out yet. I will continue looking later tonight.

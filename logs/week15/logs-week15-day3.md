# Week 15, Day 3 Log 2025-12-10

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Changed my importing approach to vendor method.
-   Setup the SCF vendor and confirmed it is usable after activating my plugin.
-   Fixed the import error, user can now sync the CPT's etc if they want to, otherwise they can create their own

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – I have been trying to get my imports working, multiple commits and prompts
-   0.5 hrs - did an audit on my current plugin to see what I need to do to implement the vendor.
-   0.75 hrs - Setting up the SCF vendor
-   1.0 hrs - Attempting to get the CPT's, Taxonomies and Custom Fields to populate in the SCF menu.
-   1.0 hrs - Fixing the import errors and ensuring everything works on a fresh WP site.

## Notes

-   I have been trying for long now to get the fields to import but it wont work so I decided I will switch to the vendor method as that was working for me before.
-   I am not sure why it is not working now, I have done this in the beginning and it worked perfectly. I do not mind troubleshooting more, I just stress because this is delaying my website.

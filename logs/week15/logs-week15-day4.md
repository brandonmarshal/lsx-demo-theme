## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed all the comments in coderabbits code review, it had a lot of security and validation improvements.  

## Time Logs

-   3.5 hrs – Working through coderabbit review comments and implementing then testing. 

---

## Notes

-   To get a review from coderabbit right at the end is not a good approach. I should do more frequent coderabbit reviews on my commits, sometimes it just takes long.

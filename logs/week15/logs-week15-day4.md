# Week 15, Day 4 Log 2025-12-11

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed all the comments in coderabbits code review, it had a lot of security and validation improvements.
-   Plugin has been ZIPPED and ready for deployment on my staging site.
-   Setup my plugin on my site. The blocks are giving issues
-   My Cpts etc are all loading correctly and that is the main goal, so I will work with that so long to improve my site. 

## Time Logs

-   3.5 hrs – Working through coderabbit review comments and implementing then testing.
-   0.5 hrs - Getting Copilots review and then checking it to make sure there are no critical issues
-   0.5 hrs - Built ZIP but was too large then figured out what I can remove to make it smaller (node_modules)
-   2.0 hrs - Working on my Fish, Gear and Area posts.
-   0.5 hrs - Installed my plugin on my WP site and tested all features.
-   1.0 hrs - Created new page designs that work with my custom fields and made more edits to posts

## Notes

-   To get a review from coderabbit right at the end is not a good approach. I should do more frequent coderabbit reviews on my commits, sometimes it just takes long.
-   For some reason the blocks are now not working after they worked 100%. It is frustrating but I am going to focus rather on improving my site with what I have, because its enough for now, then later I can go back and focus on the blocks again.

# Week 15, Day 4 Log 2025-12-11

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed all the comments in coderabbits code review, it had a lot of security and validation improvements.
-   PLugin has been ZIPPED and ready for deployment on my staging site. 

## Time Logs

-   3.5 hrs – Working through coderabbit review comments and implementing then testing.
-   0.5 hrs - Getting Copilots review and then checking it to make sure there are no critical issues
-   0.5 hrs - Built ZIP but was too large then figured out what I can remove to make it smaller (node_modules) 

---

## Notes

-   To get a review from coderabbit right at the end is not a good approach. I should do more frequent coderabbit reviews on my commits, sometimes it just takes long.

## Notes

- So far I definitely understand what the Design System is and what it is used for.
- I am going to get the design tokens (foundations) and the components into the Six Cats Design system and then see what I need to do from there.
- If there are any components that need fixing before I copy them, I will fix those first.
- I need to collect the foundations from the Six Cats prototype in order to create them correctly in the Design System.
- I have managed to get a foundations page for the Six Cats, I am not 100% sure what is possibly missing, to my understanding I covered at least the basics of what is required.
- I found a very nice plugin that helps me build very neat design templates.

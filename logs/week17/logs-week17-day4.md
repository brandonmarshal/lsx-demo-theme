# Week 17, Day 4 Log 2026-01-08

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have completed the Design System course
-   I have created some components so long for Six Cats, like logo, icons, navigation, info cards.
-   Created components for the delivery page, not fully complete.
-   I copied the About and Flower page. Then did aligment of the components by adding Auto layout and padding to those that required it. 

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs - Completed the Design System course and started building Six Cats components where I can.
-   1.5 hrs - Created some components and patterns for the Delivery page.
-   1.5 hrs - Copied the about page and started organising its layout, adding auto layout where it was needed and fixing the spacing
-   2.0 hrs - Finished aligning the about page and started with the flower page

## Notes

-   The Design System course did not have a practical follow along like the previous course. I used Six Cats as my practical to create what I learnt from the course.
-   The components and patterns I created for the delivery page are minimal, but I do not want to do too much before the Six Cats prototype is completely fixed.
-   I am now going to continue building some components and patterns for the about page.
-   I have also realised that my components are not setup as universal, it is using Six Cats data. These need to be made as generic components.

## Notes

-   Zared has been extremely helpful, I really enjoy the meetings we have.
-   I understand what the Google docs purpose is, now I can continue to build the planning doc for six cats now that I understand EVERYTHING on the prototype needs to be included.
-   Having references like the Medical Academic is very helpful for me to understand.

## Notes

- I understand the importance of the planning doc, it makes sense to have all the foundations from the begin as it keeps me and the AI agent on track.
- For the rest of the afternoon I am going to go through the documents Ash has shared with me as well as the new tabs he has created in the Six Cats planning doc. These tabs are very important to understand.

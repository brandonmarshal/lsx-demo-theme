## Notes

- I see now how the MCP server works for Figma. I have created the repo and I have also published the sixcats library with the components I have so far. I am struggling to get the Figma Desktop to connect to the new repo I created. It does not pick up the new repo and I checked in the connected apps section in my repos settings, Figma is a connected APP but I do not have access to see the config.

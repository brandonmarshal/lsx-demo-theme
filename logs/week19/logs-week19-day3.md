# Week 19, Day 3 Log 2026-01-21

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Collected more components and patterns from the Sixcats pages.
-   I have organised the existing components, patterns and blocks. I can now continue to create these components and then organise them immediately. 

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – Collecting components and patterns from Six cats pages
-   2.5 hrs - Finding the best way to organise my components and patterns
-   3.5 hr - Continued to organise my patterns, blocks and components into their sections, also been creating new patterns and components and adding them into their groups.

## Notes

- I have decided on using "Atoms", "Molecules", "Organisms", "Templates" and "Overlay". Basically everything on the site will fit within one of these categories.
- I have started with the method I mentioned above for organisation and it is working well. The file is easier to navigate now and find things. I have also used "/" for the naming of the components to ensure that they are well organised in the Assets from the beginning.
- I am not 100% sure if the way I am organising things are correct, but it is better than everything lying around, I have added heading to make it obvious where certain components and patterns are.

# Week 19, Day 4 Log 2026-01-22

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Read my article for yesterday. As I was unable to attend to it last night.
-   Collected components and extracted the Figma design to Github to test how it work.
-   Catchup meet with Zared
-   Took some time to go through the "Standardising Presets and Tokens in Block Themes" doc to better understand how variables are being setup
-   Started editing the Sixcats variables to align with this new standard. 

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Read through my article: Design system 102: How to build a design system
-   1.0 hrs - Finished off the components I was busy with yesterday and then I attempted to test the MCP extraction to Github.
-   0.75 hrs - Catchup with Zared, he showed me the new standards and guidelines for setting up variables in our design systems
-   1.0 hrs - Collected components and organised them accordingly.
-   1.5 hrs - Reading through google doc and then starting to change the variables on sixcats
-   1.0 hrs - Still busy working on the variables, applying the new standards.

## Notes

-   What I learnt from this article:
-   Lay the groundwork - This step is basically gathering what you currently already have and know about the Design system. Choosing the team that will work on the design system and then defining the guidelines of the Design System
-   Define your foundations - define your foundations is just setting up the main stuff like colors, fonts, icons, spacing, grids and accessibility so the whole design system stays consistent, looks clean and works properly for everyone
-   Build your design system - Build your design system in Figma is about reviewing existing designs and code, creating reusable components, variables, and styles with clear, functional names that describe their purpose, and organizing everything neatly in Figma libraries so the whole team can share and use the same elements consistently without confusion.

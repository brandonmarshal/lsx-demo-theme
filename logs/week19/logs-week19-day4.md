## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Read my article for yesterday. As I was unable to attend to it last night.

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Read through my article: Design system 102: How to build a design system

---

## Notes

-   What I learnt from this article:
-   Lay the groundwork - This step is basically gathering what you currently already have and know about the Design system. Choosing the team that will work on the design system and then defining the guidelines of the Design System
-   Define your foundations - define your foundations is just setting up the main stuff like colors, fonts, icons, spacing, grids and accessibility so the whole design system stays consistent, looks clean and works properly for everyone
-   Build your design system - Build your design system in Figma is about reviewing existing designs and code, creating reusable components, variables, and styles with clear, functional names that describe their purpose, and organizing everything neatly in Figma libraries so the whole team can share and use the same elements consistently without confusion.

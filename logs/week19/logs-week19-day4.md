-   Collected components and extracted the Figma design to Github to test how it work.
-   Catchup meet with Zared

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Read through my article: Design system 102: How to build a design system
-   1.0 hrs - Finished off the components I was busy with yesterday and then I attempted to test the MCP extraction to Github.
-   0.75 hrs - Catchup with Zared, he showed me the new standards and guidelines for setting up variables in our design systems
-   1.0 hrs - Collected components and organised thme accordingly.

## Notes

-   What I learnt from this article:
-   Lay the groundwork - This step is basically gathering what you currently already have and know about the Design system. Choosing the team that will work on the design system and then defining the guidelines of the Design System
-   Define your foundations - define your foundations is just setting up the main stuff like colors, fonts, icons, spacing, grids and accessibility so the whole design system stays consistent, looks clean and works properly for everyone
-   Build your design system - Build your design system in Figma is about reviewing existing designs and code, creating reusable components, variables, and styles with clear, functional names that describe their purpose, and organizing everything neatly in Figma libraries so the whole team can share and use the same elements consistently without confusion.

### What have you accomplished today?

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs - Catchup with Zared

---

## Notes

-   The components are actually taking quite some time. It is taking time because I exrtact the patterns from a page and then I extract the components from those patterns. Then I rebuild the pattern using and instance of the components I created.
-   Unfortunately I do not think I will meet my commitment regarding the components this week, I was a little bit over my head.
-   In the meeting with Zared, he gave me some really helpful pointers. He recommended I slightly refine my colour palette naming for CTA, Brand and Accent. Unfortunately I was not adding all the variables to the components as I created them and that needs to be rectified before I continue collecting more components.

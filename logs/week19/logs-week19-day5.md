## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Working on components for Sixcats

## Time Logs

-   1.5 hrs – Working on the components

---

## Notes

-   The components are actually taking quite some time. It is taking time because I exrtact the patterns from a page and then I extract the components from those patterns. Then I rebuild the pattern using and instance of the components I created.
-   Unfortunately I do not think I will meet my commitment regarding the components this week, I was a little bit over my head.

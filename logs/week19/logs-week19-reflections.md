# Week 19 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Completed the Figma MCP course, including bonus content.
-   Read articles on design systems: "Design system documentation", "Design System Metrics", and "Design system 102: How to build a design system".
-   Learned about standardizing presets and tokens in block themes through documentation and meetings.
-   Downloaded and explored Antigravity IDE via a beginner's YouTube video.
-   Participated in catchup meetings with Zared and Chris.
-   Set up Asana tasks, followed up on work email, and established planning and commitments for the week.

### What went well?

-   Successfully set up Asana tasks, planning, and weekly commitments.
-   Configured Figma MCP globally and enabled Desktop MCP in the Sixcats DS.
-   Published the Sixcats library to test MCP server tools.
-   Made good progress on Sixcats variables, including spacing, colors, and typography scales.
-   Created base files in the Sixcats-club repo.
-   Organized existing components, patterns, and blocks into categories like Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Overlay for better navigation.
-   Extracted Figma designs to Github to test MCP extraction functionality.
-   Applied new variables standards to Sixcats, converting variables and adding presets for MCP extraction.

### What can be improved?

-   Time management on components, as they are taking longer than anticipated and may not meet weekly commitments.
-   Ensure variables are consistently added to components during creation to avoid later rectification.
-   Reading articles on schedule, as one was missed and had to be caught up the next day.

### What have you learned?

-   How the Figma MCP server works, including connecting to repos, publishing libraries, and troubleshooting connections.
-   Best practices for organizing components and patterns in design systems using categories like Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Overlay.
-   Foundations of building design systems: laying groundwork, defining foundations (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, grids, accessibility), and building reusable components with consistent naming.
-   Importance of clear, functional naming and organization in Figma libraries for team collaboration.
-   New standards for setting up variables in block themes, including refining color palette naming for CTA, Brand, and Accent.
-   Basics of Antigravity IDE and its potential applications.

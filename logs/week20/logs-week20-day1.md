## Notes

-   I need to find out about the styles in the variables, I am not 100% sure if I need to work on those as well before applying the variables to my components, I will bring this up in my next catchup with Zared.
-   Creating variables and adding them to components I collect is not difficult but it is time consuming, as I usually find a previous mistake that I then need to fix. Slowly but surely this design system is coming together.
-   The big sections of the variables I created are now done. This is taking long because there is a lot to do. Each pattern has text, that means I need to insert the text component and replace the text again, this ensures the patterns are 100% built from components.

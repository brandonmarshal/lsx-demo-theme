# Week 20, Day 2 Log 2026-01-27

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   I have organised more components by adding them to thier categories.
-   I have created text components to be able to replace all text on the patterns and components
-   I have started replacing the components on the patterns I collected, to ensure the entire pattern is made up of my components and not from the prototype. This includes adding the created variables to them.
-   Finalising the patterns and components for Mooiberry page. 

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – Working on the components and patterns
-   2.5 hrs - Working on the Mooiberry page, basically done fixing all the components and adding correct variables
-   0.5 hrs - Catchup meeting with Zared. 
-   1.5 hrs - Completed the Mooiberry page and organised the components, I also completed the bundles page components and patterns, organising them now.

## Notes

-   This process is taking long, I am learning how this is meant to be done correctly through practical experience, I am definitely not going to be as fast as someone with experience.
-   Break down of what I am actually doing:
    -   Every single text on every component needs to be replaced with a "TEXT COMPONENT", then I need to re-type what that text said. This is what I was told is the correct way to do it.
    -   Every section on every patterns needs to be built from components I collect. They need to be copies of an instance basically.
-   These are the reasons that this is taking so much time, I am not wasting time, I am learning and I feel I have learnt a lot through trial and error.
-   In my catchup meet with Zared, he expressed to me that how I have been collecting and organising components are acceptable and I can continue with that workflow. I will now continue with this workflow and I should definitely be able to streamline the collection of the components now.

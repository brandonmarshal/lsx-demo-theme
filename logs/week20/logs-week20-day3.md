## Notes

-   I notice that the Sixcats prototype is changing a lot, this does not really positively affect my component collection process as I see again there are components I have already created and now they are changed.
-   I am not re-doing components now, I am going to continue to collect all the components, then I will come back to these. It is impossible to work to a set plan when things change regularly.
-   I am now collecting main components according to the doc.

## Notes

-   I will setup a meet today with Zared before his leave.
-   In the meeting with Zared we discussed the following: 
  - JSON Extraction Skill: Prototype nearly complete for extracting theme variables into JSON for MCP integration, enhancing automation and reducing manual input.
  - Token Strategy for Modes: Light/dark mode switching will use variable tokens, preventing component duplication and improving maintainability and efficiency.
  - Naming Conventions: Descriptive naming of tokens will enhance reusability, with a focus on keeping the system manageable and reducing custom tokens.
  - Prototyping Importance: Prototyping will validate mode switching and component functionality; thorough page-by-page reviews are recommended for visual accuracy.

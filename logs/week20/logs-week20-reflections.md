# Week 20 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Continued building out the Sixcats design system:
    -   Finalised major variable sets and applied them across many existing components.
    -   Created and wired up text components so patterns are fully built from components.
    -   Systematically collected and organised components and patterns across multiple pages (Mooiberry, Bundles, Mushrooms, Refer, Cannabis Cultivation, Harvesting, Packaging, Grading, About megamenu).
-   Invested in learning and workflow improvement:
    -   Read/watched content on design systems and Figma workflows, including “How to streamline your design system workflow in Figma.”
    -   Explored and started planning AI/agent skills for design system automation (JSON extraction from Figma, colour extraction, WCAG checks, colour clustering).
    -   Read more about Claude skills, agents, and related repos for future automation work.

### What went well?

-   Made steady, visible progress on the design system despite its complexity:
    -   Completed the core variables work and began confidently applying them to components.
    -   Established and refined a clear workflow for collecting, categorising, and wiring components and patterns, which is now feeling faster and more efficient.
    -   Successfully re-built patterns so they are composed of your own components and text components rather than prototype fragments.
-   Managed shifting prototypes and evolving designs pragmatically:
    -   Chose not to constantly redo components when the prototype changed, instead focusing on collecting all components first and revisiting changes later.
    -   Validated your approach with Zared, which provided reassurance that your workflow is solid and acceptable.
-   Took initiative around automation and future tooling:
    -   Identified practical limitations of the Figma MCP (e.g., not reading variables directly from the Variables page) and proposed a workable workaround using a dedicated Tokens frame.
    -   Started building concrete agent skills for colour extraction, WCAG contrast checking, and colour clustering to support accessible theming and mode switching.
-   Maintained accountability and time management:
    -   Logged time clearly and transparently, including noting when lunch ran long and deliberately catching up later.
    -   Stayed engaged and reflective about your own learning curve and speed.

### What have you learned?

-   Practical, hands‑on design system building:
    -   How time‑consuming but valuable it is to ensure patterns are fully component‑driven, including text components and shared variables.
    -   The importance of naming, structure, and organisation so that components remain reusable and maintainable as the system grows.
-   Working effectively under changing requirements:
    -   That large, evolving prototypes will keep changing, and it’s more sustainable to adopt a strategy (collect all components first, then refine) than to chase every change immediately.
    -   Getting explicit alignment with a teammate (like your conversation with Zared) can turn uncertainty into confidence and unlock faster progress.
-   Foundations for AI‑assisted design workflows:
    -   How agent skills and MCPs can plug into the design system workflow (colour extraction, WCAG checks, JSON variable export).
    -   Current constraints of tools like the Figma MCP and how to design around them (e.g., token frames for variable export).
-   Personal process and growth:
    -   That your slower pace at this stage is largely about learning a complex, professional workflow rather than a lack of effort.
    -   Trial and error is giving you a much deeper understanding of how robust design systems are actually built, not just in theory but in real, messy projects.

## Time Logs

## Notes

- I built the skills agents last week and now I have set it up in my repo. When I go over to claude to try add the skills I get an error, so it seems I am not doing something correcltly. I have not been able to figure it out yet, so I stopped and I am going to continue with the Six Cats DS and collecting components in the meantime.

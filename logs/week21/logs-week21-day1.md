## Notes

- I built the skills agents last week and now I have set it up in my repo. When I go over to claude to try add the skills I get an error, so it seems I am not doing something correcltly. I have not been able to figure it out yet, so I stopped and I am going to continue with the Six Cats DS and collecting components in the meantime.
- After I am done collecting the rest of the pages in the footer, I will then do the menus and that should be everythin, of course I will go and double check all pages and make sure I have collected their components.
- I am so close to being done with the collecting of all the components, then I need to get the light mode colours and add it to the variables correclty in order to switch between modes on the components.
- I have collected 95% of the components and patterns now. Tomorrow morning I will finalise everything and then begin checking all variables are in place, so I can start adding light mode colours.

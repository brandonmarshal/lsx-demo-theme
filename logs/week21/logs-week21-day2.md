# Week 21, Day 2 Log 2026-02-03

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Collected components for the MegaMenus. AS well as adding variables to the components that did not have set variables.

## Time Logs

-   2.5 hrs – Going through components and filling in missing variables, like spacing, fontsize, etc. Also collected some components for the MegaMenus

---

## Notes

-   I still need to go back and update some of the earlier components to match the new look of the site. Buttons are also needing to be re-collected as their styles are different. But this should not take long.

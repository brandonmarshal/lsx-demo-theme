## Notes

-   Light mode colours are working fine so far, I will see if Zared is available for a meeting today, then we can discuss the MCP extraction, I am curious to see his Agent skill as well.
-   Zared confirmed our meeting for tomorrow unless I am blocked. I am not blocked at least and I will continue to adjust my extraction agent prompt to get better extractions from Figma, I will testing each extraction on my Sixcats local site.
-   I am trying a new approach on the MCP extraction workflow. I am going to edit the foundations page and add a frame that includes all my colour variables. Then I will share that frame link in vscode and use my Agents to extract all the colour variables from the frame. If that works well I will then do the same thing for typography, spacing etc.

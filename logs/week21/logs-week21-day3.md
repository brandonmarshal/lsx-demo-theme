## Notes

-   Light mode colours are working fine so far, I will see if Zared is available for a meeting today, then we can discuss the MCP extraction, I am curious to see his Agent skill as well.
-   Zared confirmed our meeting for tomorrow unless I am blocked. I am not blocked at least and I will continue to adjust my extraction agent prompt to get better extractions from Figma, I will testing each extraction on my Sixcats local site.

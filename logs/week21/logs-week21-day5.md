## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Working on extraction prompts for Figma to Wordpress
-   Catchup with Zared
-   Completed my tests with my ai agent output.
-   Setup the colour variables frames with the Figma plugin "Variables Documentation"
-   Used those frames to test Zared's agent skill.
-   Updating Variables for sixcats

## Time Logs

-   1.5 hrs – Editing my agent prompt for better extraction, I found some areas in my prompt that did not align with the google doc standardising, so I made adjustments.
-   0.5 hrs - Catchup with Zared, discussing the Figma - Wordpress extractions.
-   2.0 hrs - Finished testing the output of my agent, setup my colour variables frame with a figma plugin then started testing Zared's agent skill he shared with me.
-   1.5 hrs - Updating Sixcats variables to be able to use the orchestrator prompt Zared created.

## Notes

-   Zared has shared with me what he discovered yesterday, I will now test his agent skill on the sixcats DS, to see if it is consistent enough for us to use.
-   I was looking through the orchestrator prompt and noticed it was going to ask me for variable frames that I did not have. So I had to g and create those collections so I am able to generate that frame with the "Variables Documentation" plugin.

# Week 21 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Set up and refined Claude Agent Skills in the Sixcats repo, including research and troubleshooting errors with skill integration.
    Collected and organized components and patterns from all pages, including footer pages, MegaMenus, Delivery page, cookies banner, and Shop Menu.
    Added and updated variables (spacing, font size, colour tokens) across components to enable light/dark mode switching.
    Built foundation frames for primitive and semantic colours in Figma, and used AI agents to extract and validate colour variables.
    Collaborated with Zared and Ash, sharing extraction files and prompts, and iteratively improved agent instructions for better theme.json extraction.
    Used Figma plugins (Variables Documentation) to document and organize colour variables for extraction and theme generation.

### What went well?

-   Successfully collected and organized nearly all components and patterns, with variables applied for consistent design system integration.
    Refined agent prompts and extraction workflows, leading to improved and more consistent outputs for theme.json and colour tokens.
    Collaboration with Zared provided valuable feedback and new agent skills, accelerating progress and improving extraction quality.
    Built foundation frames for colours and began extracting them efficiently using AI agents.
    Implemented new collections for variables, enabling use of orchestrator agent for theme.json generation.

### What have you learned?

-   Gained deeper understanding of agent skill setup and prompt engineering for design system extraction.
    Learned to troubleshoot and refine AI agent instructions for more reliable and accessible outputs.
    Improved workflow for collecting, organizing, and documenting design tokens and variables in Figma for WordPress block themes.
    Recognized the importance of collaboration and feedback in refining extraction processes and agent skills.
    Developed strategies for aligning extraction workflows with standardizing presets and tokens documentation.

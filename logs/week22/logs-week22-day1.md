## Notes

- I already have variables setup so I just need to check what the properties are and then assign the same value as a variable rather. I need to also collect the styles for the different blocks and sections, I have been doing some GPT research on this and I thought it might be a good idea to build a MCP agent to extract the styles from the Figma frames.
- If I can copy a block on figma and give it to the agent to extract the block styles, that would be an efficient workflow.
- I am still trying to figure out exactly how I need to document the styles. I know It must be done in the SixCats doc, but I am not 100% sure how the doc layout needs to be. I am still figuring that out. I will discuss this with Zared in our next meeting.

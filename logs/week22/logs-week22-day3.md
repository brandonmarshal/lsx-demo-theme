-   Read 5 Ways to Improve your prototyping
-   Read Creating and organising variants
-   Read Branching in Figma
-   Read Guide to prototyping in Figma
-   Read Make your design systems work better for everyone
-   Watched a couple youtube videos from Figma, related to prototyping in Figma.
-   Setup some frames to test prototyping.
-   Setting up prototype components, like header and footer.

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Fixing some of the broken components in the Design file, and had a catchup with Ash regarding prototyping in Figma.
-   1.0 hrs - Catchup meet with Zared, and fixed some more components
-   2.0 hrs - Learning about Figma Prototyping
-   2.0 hrs - Learned more regarding the prototyping in Figma, and started setting up a simple prototype page in the design file so long.
-   1.5 hrs - Setting up basic frames for prototype practice. See notes.
-   0.75 hrs - Practicing prototyping in the Design file and setting up template frames, with homepage, shop and flower page content.

## Notes

-  I am very eager to learn about prototyping, I am sure I will get this nailed. I have plenty documentation and course work I can go through today to get my head around it.
-  I have read a lot of articles today and watched many youtube videos. I started setting up a prototype page in the design file, I definitely need to relate back to the articles as there is too much to remember, so I will use those articles as I practice the prototyping in order to get it correct from the beginning.
-  So going over and actually creating frames to prototpye is very different than just understanding an articles, so I have been going back to the articles to refresh my memory. I am getting a better understanding of prototyping the more I practice.
-  I am really starting to see how everything comes together with prototyping, I have done a lot of reading today and my mind is quite shot, tomorrow morning I will continue setting up the prototyping with a fresh mind.

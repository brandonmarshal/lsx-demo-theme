## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Fixing some of the broken components in the Design file, and had a catchup with Ash regarding prototyping in Figma.
-   1.0 hrs - Catchup meet with Zared, and fixed some more components
-   2.0 hrs - Learning about Figma Prototyping
-   2.0 hrs - Learned more regarding the prototyping in Figma, and started setting up a simple prototype page in the design file so long.

## Notes

-  I am very eager to learn about prototyping, I am sure I will get this nailed. I have plenty documentation and course work I can go through today to get my head around it.
-  I have read a lot of articles today and watched many youtube videos. I started setting up a prototype page in the design file, I definitely need to relate back to the articles as there is too much to remember, so I will use those articles as I practice the prototyping in order to get it correct from the beginning.

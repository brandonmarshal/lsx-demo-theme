## Notes

-   Ash has showed me a really neat way to organise my prototype pages, I am really glad to have seen this in the beginning so now I can start organising it that way as I work on the pages. I am very excited to do the prototyping.
-   The prototyping is very interesting, I am now going to start setting up the 3 screen size templates for Desktop, tablet and mobile.
-   I started by implementing the Shop mega menu overlay, to practice the settings for an overlay in Figma.

## Notes

-   Ash has showed me a really neat way to organise my prototype pages, I am really glad to have seen this in the beginning so now I can start organising it that way as I work on the pages. I am very excited to do the prototyping.
-   The prototyping is very interesting, I am now going to start setting up the 3 screen size templates for Desktop, tablet and mobile.
-   I started by implementing the Shop mega menu overlay, to practice the settings for an overlay in Figma.
-   With the Desktop, tablet and mobile views, I have content frames for each page, so I am going through the content page for homepage and I need to fix all the frames within to be fluid, so that when I switch to a different view, the content frame does not break, it adjusts with the frame size.
-   So I have noticed that with Tablet and mobile, I cannot use the same content block that I do for Desktop. Some auto layout alignments for Desktop are horizontally aligned and for mobile and tablet they need to be vertically aligned to fit in the screen. So I am not doing content blocks for each view.

## Notes

- I realised now that I need to rebuild the header and footer for tablet and mobile.
- I am starting to understand the mobile layouts compared to the Desktop layouts. Tablet to me, feels closer to Mobile than to Desktop, so I assume I will use the Hamburger menu again with the Tablet view.

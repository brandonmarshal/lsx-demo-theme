## Notes

- I realised now that I need to rebuild the header and footer for tablet and mobile.
- I am starting to understand the mobile layouts compared to the Desktop layouts. Tablet to me, feels closer to Mobile than to Desktop, so I assume I will use the Hamburger menu again with the Tablet view.
- The setup for Mobile so far is looking good, I still have more connections to setup.
- What I noticed was that going from Desktop design to Mobile designs is not that quick, almost everything changes in Size and needs to still align nicely and neatly, but I am definitely learning a lot during this process.
- What I was doing, was trying to take desktop sized frames and fit them into another "Mobile" sized frame, obviously did not work. Then I realised I had to make every component smaller in order to be able to shrink the whole frame to Mobile.

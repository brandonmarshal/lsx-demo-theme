## Notes

-   In my catchup with Zared we discussed Presets for the variables and which ones need to be updated. I need to update my Radius preset syntax, but otherwise my naming is all okay according to Zared.
-   He also showed me how to update my text styles which is going to help me immensely with Min and Max values.
-   Updating those styles with Sixcats actual variables was very important, I did not know that I needed to do that and It was pointed out today by Zared, so I have now updated them to use Sixcats variables.
-   The Scale plugin is very nice, it works brilliantly, the only editing that needs to be done after a resize, is the font sizes and styles, those need to be enlarged for mobile, the "scale" plugin does not adjust the text and blocks sizes.

## Notes

-   In my catchup with Zared we discussed Presets for the variables and which ones need to be updated. I need to update my Radius preset syntax, but otherwise my naming is all okay according to Zared.
-   He also showed me how to update my text styles which is going to help me immensely with Min and Max values.

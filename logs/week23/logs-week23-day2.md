## Notes

-  I am now speeding up the creation of Mobile frames, I have noticed the commmon adjustments that need to be made to get Mobile frames, with that I have a workflow now.
-  So far I am happy with the mobile prototype view, I have been testing each page as I create them and adjusting where needed as well.
-  I did not do the modal today, I got into the page creations and adding more to the prototype, I will make sure to do the Modal tomorrow morning before I continue creating more pages.

# Week 22, Day 3 Log 2026-02-18

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Adjust the existing mobile Sixcats prototype pages by correcting colour, typography and spacing variables
-   Completed the "Meet the Cats" page
-   Completed the Deals and Bundles page
-   Added connections for those pages on the Prototype
-   Read Figmas articles about branching - https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/#best-practices-when-using-branches
-   Researching glassmorphism where I found a Figma plugin for this - https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1197106608665398190/glassmorphism
-   Making adjustments to Refer page, still two more sections to do quick.

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Running through my current Mobile prototype and making adjustments to all the existing pages, changing colours and fontsizes to my variables as well.
-   2.0 hrs - Catchup meeting with Ash, and working on the mobile view pages for the Sixcats prototype
-   1.0 hrs - Reading articles about Branching in Figma and researching Glassmorphism, also made some adjustments to the refer page

## Notes

-  I am now taking some time away from the Design file to learn about Figma Branching. Then I need to update the details of the Sixcats-club repo as requested yesterday. After that I will setup a meeting that suites Zared, for us to discuss how I should go about doing the new variables in a branch
-  The branching is very similar to Github but its just for Designs and variables, the workflow stays the same. When a branch is ready, it needs to be reviewed and approved before being merged into the main file.
-  See below about Glassmorphism

## Glassmorphism

**Glassmorphism** is a modern UI design style that makes interface elements look like frosted or translucent glass.

### What It Does

Glassmorphism creates depth and layering by:

* Using **semi-transparent backgrounds**
* Applying **blur effects** (background blur / backdrop-filter)
* Adding **subtle borders and soft shadows**
* Using light gradients to simulate light passing through glass

The result is a soft, airy, futuristic feel where content appears to float above the background.

### Why Designers Use It

* Creates strong **visual hierarchy**
* Separates content without heavy solid blocks
* Adds a sense of **depth and realism**
* Works well with colorful or gradient backgrounds

### Where It’s Typically Used

* **Login & authentication cards**
* **Dashboards**
* **Modals & popups**
* **Sidebars & navigation panels**
* **Music players & mobile apps**
* Portfolio and creative websites

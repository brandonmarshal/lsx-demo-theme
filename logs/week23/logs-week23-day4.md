# Week 22, Day 4 Log 2026-02-19

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Added most of the new variables into the variables tables, now I need to add the correct values
-   Almost complete with the section styles variables, working on ALL buttons now

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Setting up half the section styles variables in the new branch on Sixcats DS.
-   1.0 hrs - Added more variables to "Styles: Sections", almost complete.

---

## Notes

-  So with the variables I am setting up the table structure so long so I dont forget or lose it. I used AI to help me with a layout for my variables tables that would work well from the beginning to the end. The only reason I have not added the values as I created the variable is because I still need to update some of the global variables to actually match the Sitemap. I will update those variables once I have the section styles layout done.

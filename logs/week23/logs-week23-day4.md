# Week 22, Day 4 Log 2026-02-19

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Added most of the new variables into the variables tables, now I need to add the correct values
-   Almost complete with the section styles variables, working on ALL buttons now
-   Working on Mobile prototype view pages, specifically refer page
-   Editing variables for section styles, working on the buttons variables update as well. 

## Time Logs

-   1.0 hrs – Setting up half the section styles variables in the new branch on Sixcats DS.
-   1.0 hrs - Added more variables to "Styles: Sections", almost complete.
-   2.0 hrs - Working on the new sections styles variables and the Mobile prortotyping pages, started reading the first article regarding Modes in Figma
-   1.5 hrs - Reading through the articles I found about Variable Modes, and practicing on the prototype, how to implement the variable modes

## Notes

-  So with the variables I am setting up the table structure so long so I dont forget or lose it. I used AI to help me with a layout for my variables tables that would work well from the beginning to the end. The only reason I have not added the values as I created the variable is because I still need to update some of the global variables to actually match the Sitemap. I will update those variables once I have the section styles layout done.
-  The button styles I was going to add to the Section styles but I realised that it needs to actually be added to the Block styles, as they are re-usable blocks, just like the cards as well.
-  I understand now how the variables modes are being used in the prototype, by adding an interation to a frame and ensuring that frame has the variables mode set to Auto.

## Notes

-  I tried to collect all the primitve colours that I can see in the Funky redesign and I am not using them to create the Dark and Light mode. I have kept my previous colours as defaults and I am naming the new varibles under Funky.
-  I am adding in more fields to the colour tokens for the Funky redesign.
-  The Funky redesign colour variables are taking some time because I am making sure to get every colour required. I have created a Funky Primitives and now I am creating Funky Dark and Funky Light mode tokens.
-  Zared gave me a lot of pointers about my prototype and really good advice, I will use that feedback to improve my design over the course of next week.

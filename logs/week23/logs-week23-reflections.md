# Week 23 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses, Learning, and Key Activities

-   Prototyped mobile views for various Sixcats pages including Flower, Refer, Delivery, About, Meet the Cats, Deals and Bundles, Mooiberry, Mushroom, and Browse by effects.
-   Updated styles and variables in the Sixcats design system, including section styles, buttons, and colour primitives.
-   Conducted research on Modals, Data structure, and Schema data.
-   Read articles on typography systems and branching in Figma.
-   Researched glassmorphism as a UI design style.
-   Watched and practiced YouTube videos on Variable Modes in Figma.
-   Set up variables for the Funky redesign, including primitives, dark mode, and light mode tokens.
-   Participated in catchup meetings with Ash and Zared to discuss progress and variables.
-   Updated and renamed the Sixcats-club repository to "sixcats-design-system" and improved its README.
-   Used AI assistance to set up variable tables for section styles.

### What went well?

-   Efficiently completed multiple mobile prototype pages, developing a streamlined workflow for creating mobile frames.
-   Successfully updated styles with variables, ensuring consistency across the design system.
-   Applied new Figma features like Variable Modes and gained proficiency in them.
-   Made significant progress on design system variables, including primitives and mode-specific tokens.
-   Received positive feedback from Zared on the prototype and design system progress.
-   Managed repository updates and naming changes effectively.

### What have you learned?

-   Typography systems in Figma, including text style basics and best practices.
-   Branching in Figma, which is similar to GitHub workflows for designs and variables.
-   Glassmorphism as a modern UI design style that creates depth with semi-transparent backgrounds, blur effects, and subtle borders.
-   Variable Modes in Figma for implementing different themes like dark and light modes.
-   The importance of aligning variables with the overall design system and sitemap.
-   Improved mobile prototyping workflow, including using plugins like Scale for resizing frames.
-   Best practices for organizing and naming variables in design systems.

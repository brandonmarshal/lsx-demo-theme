-   Completed the colour variables for the Funky Redesign, now I can start applying those colours in to the frames
-   Setup Local WP site for testing the Scclub patterns, templates and parts.
-   troubleshooting the theme.json to get the templates to not break the site and to actually load, still troubleshooting.
-   Continued troubleshooting the theme.json and found that Border and Typography sections were causing the crash

## Time Logs

-   0.75 hrs – Catchup meeting with Ash, regarding the prototypes and Sixcats files
-   2.0 hrs - Working on the Funky redesign variables, completed Primary,secondary and tertiary buttons and navs
-   1.0 hrs - I have now completed the colours for the Funky Redesign
-   3.0 hrs - Setup a local WP site to test Scclub theme from Figma, the theme.json is causing error on the Front-page.html so I have been troubleshooting the theme.json in my forked version and testing, so far it seems to be the typography setting and I now see another section settings as well, still troubleshooting.
-   1.5 hrs - continued troubleshooting the theme.json. It was border and typography sections that broke it.

## Notes

-   I have collected a lot of colours which I feel do cover most of the colours on the Website. I can now do testing on frames and in my prototype to make sure all the colours are working well and then I can make adjustments where needed.
-   I am troubleshooting with my AI agent, I am making the agent write reports liek Ash discussed with me this morning, I created a README.md in the reports file and that is the instructions to guide the AI agent how to do the reports and the naming conventions etc.
-   I am still troubleshooting the theme.json but I have so far discovered the typography section setting is a problem, but there is another section as well that is casuing the crash.
-   I am now auditing the Border and Typography section and seeing where the problems are being caused. I am reporting everything in a .md file as the AI Agent works.

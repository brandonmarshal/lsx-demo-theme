## Notes

-   The theme.json is now working, everything is in the report I created in my forked repo.
-   I created a backup of the theme.json and then created a basic one, tested it and worked, then I started added section by section from the backup until it crashed, to figure out which ones were causing the issue, now I have edited those sections, it was typo and borders again.
-   I have actually done majority of the Dark mode pages, then I will move on to the light mode, from there I will be able to start applying their colours from the Variables.

## Notes

-   The prototype was using the old styled pages, since the styling and some blocks have been updated, I have to update the DS to align. I am not working on the "new" components and adding the new variables I setup last week for the Funky redesign.
-   This process is going to take some time, I am going to try work overhours this week to speed this up and not delay anyone.
-   The process is taking long but this is the way it must be done and the proper way. I MUST create components for everything, I was not doing that, so I do think I will need to spend some overtime at least this weekend to catchup.

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Working on the mobile view prototype, specifically updating the Light mode homepage to the current and then creating components and adding variables
-   Continued working on the components for homepage, completed the featured cards now, I created variants of the cards with their different states like Out of stock, Sale, grouped etc.
-   Completed more sections of the home page, converting the new design to mobile size, creating components for different sections and adding variables EVERYWHERE.
-   Completed more sections on the homepage, I am doing the last 3 sections now, then I can continue with the shop page.

## Notes

-   The prototype was using the old styled pages, since the styling and some blocks have been updated, I have to update the DS to align. I am not working on the "new" components and adding the new variables I setup last week for the Funky redesign.
-   This process is going to take some time, I am going to try work overhours this week to speed this up and not delay anyone.
-   The process is taking long but this is the way it must be done and the proper way. I MUST create components for everything, I was not doing that, so I do think I will need to spend some overtime at least this weekend to catchup.
-   There are a lot of components on the homepage so I am hoping that after I collect all those for the prototype, I will be able to use those on other pages too, like the cards for the shop page for example might make it a lot faster.
-   My colours are still on the branch I created in the Design File. Once I can approve the branch and merge it into my main file, I can apply those colour to these components then toggle dark and light mode.

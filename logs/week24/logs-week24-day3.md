## Notes

-   The prototype was using the old styled pages, since the styling and some blocks have been updated, I have to update the DS to align. I am not working on the "new" components and adding the new variables I setup last week for the Funky redesign.
-   This process is going to take some time, I am going to try work overhours this week to speed this up and not delay anyone.

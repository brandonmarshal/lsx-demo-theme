## Notes

-   I was now able to merge my Figma branch which is very helpful, because now I have all my variables invluding the colours for the new design. Now I can add all those to the components.
-   This process is going to take some time for sure, but I know this is best to do in the beginning, once I have every component audited and the variables are added, the prototype will work better.
-   As I work on the components and start adding colours, I notice some colours do not exist, then I need to go and create those colours in the primitives first and then create a Token set for it. But I guarentee ALL the colours will be 100% correct and in place.

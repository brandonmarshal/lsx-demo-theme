# Week 24, Day 4 Log 2026-02-26

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Catchup with Zared regarding Figma branch
-   Working on card components for the new sixcats design
-   Added colour variables to some of the components I have collected
-   Added more colours to the theme, because some colours were not avaialable as variables.
-   I have been adding colour variables to all the newly collected components
-   I have updated the colour palette to accomodate for more of the colours on the site.
-   Added colour variables to one of the cards component and setup Dark and Light mode, the mode switching is working nciely. 

## Time Logs

-   2.0 hrs – Catchup meet with Zared and working on card components for the new sixcats design.
-   1.5 hrs - Added colour varaibles to components and testing their Light and Dark modes. Also created more colours in the variables as some were not available that I needed.
-   2.0 hrs - Working on colour variables and adding colours to all collected components

## Notes

-   I was now able to merge my Figma branch which is very helpful, because now I have all my variables invluding the colours for the new design. Now I can add all those to the components.
-   This process is going to take some time for sure, but I know this is best to do in the beginning, once I have every component audited and the variables are added, the prototype will work better.
-   As I work on the components and start adding colours, I notice some colours do not exist, then I need to go and create those colours in the primitives first and then create a Token set for it. But I guarentee ALL the colours will be 100% correct and in place.

## Notes

-   I have a lot to catchup on the Design File because the designs are updated, I have also recently built a new colour palette for the Funky Redesign and I need to assign those colours to ALL components.
-   I have got the hang of asssigning the variables, especially the colours, which makes it a lot easier to setup the Dark and Light modes for all the components.
-   Luckily some cards on other pages are the same as the ones on the Homepage, so I was able to copy those and use them as well.

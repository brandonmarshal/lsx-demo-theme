# Week 5, Day 2 Log 2025-10-01

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Worked on the template doc but I was doing it all wrong so spent most of the day in docs.
-   Had a meet with @Ash last night and he showed me how to create my own copilot space and to add relevant content in it to work on my site.
-   Catchup with @Seren this morning.
-   Looking into the Awesome Github Copilot MCP Server
-   I have received a couple of files from Ash that I need to revise and tweak if required.
-   I need to reorganise files in my project repo and rename using 01, 02 values for the lists.
-   I need to complete the Template documents today so I can download them as .md and commit them to my repository.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

I feel like I learned an important lesson today. While I spent most of the day struggling with the template documentation approach, the meeting with @Ash was extremely valuable and opened up new possibilities for organizing my Copilot workspace more effectively.

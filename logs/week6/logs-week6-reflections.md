# Week 06 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week marked a major transition from planning to active website development. Day 1 was productive with extensive Google Docs organization for the fishing website project, establishing a solid foundation for development. The documentation work, while time-intensive, created the necessary structure for moving forward. Testing ImageSorcerer MCP server provided valuable learning about available tools. Day 2 built on this momentum with project document updates, research into image generation MCP servers, and important learning about WordPress taxonomies. The project issues were successfully set up for Copilot workflow, and productive meetings with both @Seren and @José kept everything on track. Day 3 saw the finalization of project planning and dedicated focus on project work. Day 4 was a breakthrough day with successful resolution of local setup issues and significant technical progress including theme.json updates, header/footer templates, and base generic templates (404, etc.). Day 5 continued the momentum with content development - blog posts got content and featured images, Fish Species were populated, and header adjustments were made. The week showed consistent progress from documentation through to active development.

### What can be improved?

While the week was generally productive, there are areas for improvement. The documentation work on Day 1 took longer than expected and required extensive AI prompting, highlighting the need for more efficient documentation strategies. The ImageSorcerer MCP server testing revealed it doesn't support image generation as expected, showing the importance of thorough tool evaluation before integration. Throughout the week, I maintained good momentum but could benefit from better time estimation - some content development tasks took longer than anticipated. The Fish Species content and header adjustments still need refinement, indicating that initial implementations may need multiple iterations. Better planning for content detail requirements could help avoid the need for extensive revisions. Also, maintaining dedicated study time while focusing on project development remains a challenge that needs better balance.

### What have you learned?

This week provided significant hands-on learning in WordPress development and project management. I gained practical experience with local development environment setup and troubleshooting, which is crucial for independent development work. Working with theme.json, header/footer templates, and generic templates (like 404 pages) gave me a solid foundation in WordPress theme structure. I learned about WordPress taxonomies and terminology, which helps me understand the platform more comprehensively. The experience with different MCP servers (ImageSorcerer testing) taught me about evaluating and selecting appropriate tools for specific needs. Project documentation and organization proved to be time-intensive but essential for successful development. Most importantly, I learned that consistent daily progress, even if incremental, leads to significant outcomes - from Google Docs organization on Monday to having a functioning website with content by Friday. The regular catchups with @Seren and @José demonstrated the value of consistent communication in project success.

### What are your next actions?

-   Complete the landing page development to replace blog posts as the homepage - this was planned but not finished this week
-   Refine Fish Species content with more detailed explanations as identified during Day 5
-   Continue header improvements and typography adjustments to achieve better design consistency
-   Expand content for gear and stories custom post types (CPTs) to make the site more comprehensive
-   Research and implement alternative image generation MCP servers since ImageSorcerer didn't meet expectations
-   Continue regular catchups with @Seren and @José as they've proven valuable for maintaining momentum
-   Apply the solid technical foundation (theme.json, templates) built this week to accelerate future development
-   Maintain the positive feeling and momentum established this week into next week's work
-   Balance continued website development with dedicated study time
-   Build on the successful local environment setup to explore more advanced development features

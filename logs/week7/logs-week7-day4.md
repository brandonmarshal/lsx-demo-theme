## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

Yesterday I spent more time than I should have with my header and footer, I ran into some confusions with duplicating and implementing patterns and templates. I figured it out now so future tasks wont take as long as this one.

-   Catchup with @Seren and @José
-   Got Gravity Forms working
-   Installed BugHerd locally (updated local URL to include name for board)
-   Meeting with Barbs
-   Adjustments to homepage (not yet implemented on staging)
-   Intermediate Theme Developer course session ([Intermediate Theme Developer](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/))

### How do you feel about today's progress?

Feeling good today.

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Created custom colour palettes on Figma for my website.
-   Exported the colour schemes I created to the Lightspeed Figma pages.
-   Had a meeting with Barbs (35 mins).
-   Meeting with Jose and Seren (1 hour).
-   Practicing settings in Figma to get used to navigating the UI and where to find tools, actions, etc.
-   Created a couple of tasks this morning on Asana from previous Slack messages that I had not turned into tasks yet.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

I feel good about today's progress. Establishing the custom colour palettes moves the visual identity forward, and exporting them to the Lightspeed shared Figma space sets up reuse. Meetings with Barbs, Jose, and Seren kept alignment strong. Getting more fluent with Figma navigation is improving speed for future design work. Capturing missed Slack items into Asana tightened task tracking.

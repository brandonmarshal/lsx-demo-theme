# Week 07 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

Consistent forward progress on foundational site work and learning. Early in the week I organised the home page, stood up the about page, and redesigned header/footer which improved structure and visual clarity. I steadily advanced two WordPress Learn courses (low-code block theme and Intermediate Theme Developer) while simultaneously applying concepts directly in the Site Editor (template parts, mobile layouts, patterns, colour systems). Mid‑week focus on mobile friendliness, new styles, and pattern creation strengthened responsive design. Later in the week I resolved tooling/config items (Gravity Forms working, BugHerd configured), created custom Figma colour palettes and exported them for shared use, and captured previously missed tasks into Asana, tightening project tracking. Regular catchups with @Seren and meetings with @José and Barbs kept alignment strong. Overall: good balance of learning, implementation, design refinement, and process hygiene.

### What can be improved?

Some redesign tasks (headers/footers and mobile adjustments) took longer than ideal due to experimentation and pattern duplication confusion; tightening an upfront checklist for pattern vs template vs part choices will reduce friction. Figma acclimation still costs time—continued deliberate practice should shorten future design cycles. Balancing deep course study against hands‑on site changes risks splitting focus; I can schedule explicit blocks for uninterrupted learning. Need to ensure every emerging Slack action becomes an Asana task immediately (improved late week). Mobile pattern creation can be more systematic with defined breakpoints and accessibility review earlier. Colour system decisions should be validated for contrast before wider implementation.

### What have you learned?

Deeper grasp of block theme composition: template parts vs patterns vs global styles and how design tokens (colour palettes) bridge Figma and theme.json. Learned practical responsive adjustments and the value of iterating header/footer early. Reinforced course concepts by immediately applying them (low‑code and intermediate theme). Improved fluency navigating Figma UI and exporting/shared asset workflows. Strengthened habit of translating informal discussions into tracked tasks. Gained insight into pacing—alternating structured learning blocks with focused implementation sprints preserves momentum and retention.

### What are your next actions?

-   Finalise and implement refined header/footer and mobile patterns with accessibility & contrast checks
-   Integrate new colour palettes into theme.json tokens and validate WCAG contrast before broad usage
-   Continue progressing Intermediate Theme Developer course with scheduled daily focused block
-   Systematise pattern creation (naming, breakpoints, purpose) and document a quick checklist
-   Apply responsive/mobile adjustments to remaining templates (about, home variations) and test in Site Editor
-   Maintain daily catchups and immediate Asana task capture from Slack/meetings
-   Schedule Figma practice micro‑sessions to reinforce speed navigating tools
-   Leverage Gravity Forms and BugHerd setup for early user flow & feedback capture on staging once designs land

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Spent most of the day adding and structuring new site content locally: created multiple fish posts and built out the fish species page.
-   Added categories, labels, and tags across all posts for better organisation and discoverability.
-   Create and publish fish species content structure
-   Add taxonomy (categories, tags) to existing and new posts
-   Continue refining content organisation

### How do you feel about today's progress?

Productive on the content side, but feeling demotivated due to rude and unprofessional comments directed at interns. The negativity is reducing my initial excitement to learn, even though I'm still making tangible progress. We are "interns" in the end.

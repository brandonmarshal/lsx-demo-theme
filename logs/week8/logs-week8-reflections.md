### What went well?

Strong recovery from early-week stress to establish productive workflow patterns and deliver key outcomes. Successfully expanded the custom post type system by implementing gear posts with consistent styling patterns matching the fish species page, demonstrating growing confidence with WordPress development patterns. Maintained excellent progress on learning objectives (see Courses Completed section above) - completed 6 comprehensive modules across Gravity Forms styling and GitHub collaboration skills, while beginning Asana Foundations training. Mid-week focus on design systems paid off - finalised colour palettes, font pairings, and conducted thorough accessibility checks, establishing solid visual foundation. Implemented better project tracking by consistently reporting progress in Asana, which significantly improved team communication and reduced stress levels. Regular catchups with team members (Jose, Seren, Barbara) maintained alignment and provided valuable guidance. Site editor work progressed smoothly with pattern refinements, mobile menu adjustments, and template enhancements. Week concluded with positive momentum and sense of accomplishment.

### What can be improved?

Initial week stress stemmed from feeling behind and concern about letting team down - better early communication about progress concerns could prevent this anxiety buildup. Gravity Forms learning (4 comprehensive modules completed), while thorough, could be more immediately applicable if paired with active form implementation on the project. Time management between structured learning (6 courses completed plus 1 ongoing) and hands-on development work needs ongoing refinement to maximise both retention and practical application. Some template editing work remained in local environment only - establishing clearer review/deployment checkpoints would accelerate progress to staging. Personal commitments (family visit Day 3) impacted productivity - better advance planning for known interruptions could help maintain momentum.

### What have you learned?

Discovered the transformative power of consistent Asana reporting for reducing stress and improving team transparency - what initially felt like overhead became a valuable communication and confidence tool. Reinforced understanding of WordPress custom post type patterns by successfully replicating fish species approach for gear posts, building systematic development skills. Gained comprehensive Gravity Forms styling expertise through four specialized modules covering Orbital integration, styling guides, CSS ready classes, and layouts add-on functionality. Acquired practical GitHub conflict resolution and repository management skills that will be essential for collaborative development. Learned the importance of early design system decisions (colours, fonts, accessibility) as foundation work that accelerates later styling tasks. Began developing project management competencies through Asana Foundations training. Understood how regular team check-ins provide both guidance and accountability that improves focus and reduces isolation. Experienced how workflow improvements (better tracking, consistent reporting) can transform week trajectory from stressful to productive.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue building on improved Asana reporting workflow and maintain proactive communication about progress and blockers
-   Complete Asana Foundations skill badge and apply project management learnings to current workflow
-   Export and deploy recent template edits from local environment to staging site for team review
-   Expand custom post type skills by exploring additional content types or advanced features
-   Apply accessibility and design system knowledge to broader site templates and patterns
-   Schedule regular "deployment checkpoints" to move local work to staging more systematically
-   Build on GitHub skills by practicing collaborative workflows and branch management
-   Maintain momentum from positive week-end feeling by documenting successful workflow patterns
-   Plan ahead for known schedule interruptions to minimise impact on development flow

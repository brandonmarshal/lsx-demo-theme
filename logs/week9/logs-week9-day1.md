# Week 9, Day 1 Log 2025-10-27

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Catchup with Seren (progress alignment and planning)
-   Gathered study material for SASS, SCSS and various config workflows ([Asana Task](https://app.asana.com/1/1152726221312/project/1211170302971594/task/1211753893230860?focus=true))
-   Created a new release tag for the repo and updated the changelog
-   Used Copilot to review previous task work and generate a checklist of remaining actions ([Issue #60](https://github.com/brandonmarshal/lsx-demo-theme/issues/60))

### How do you feel about today's progress?

It was a slower, non‑practical day, but still purposeful. I set up learning resources, aligned with Seren, and prepared structured next steps via Copilot and the release process. Foundation work should make tomorrow's implementation smoother.

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Updated the Tools table in Google Docs to include all added sub tabs (tools).

-   Researched for a basic understanding of creating custom post type plugins.
-   Created `instructions.md` and `files.md` for Copilot to use in VS Code to help build the plugin.

-   Meeting with Ash to discuss my tasks for the docs and extensions.json

### How do you feel about today's progress?

Today started late due to personal things with my brother-in-law, but once I got going the flow was good. I made steady progress across research, documentation, and theme learning. Overall it felt like a productive, positive day.

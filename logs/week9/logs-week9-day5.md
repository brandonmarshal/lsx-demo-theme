# Week 9, Day 5 Log 2025-10-31

## Today's Progress

### What have you accomplished today?

-   Created custom instructions for copilot to create 12 Github ISSUES from Ash's instructions, 1 being an EPIC and the other 11 Sub-issues. I will add this file to my google drive as well.
-   Meeting with Ash and Seren
-   Getting Asana tasks sorted and aligned
-   Additional Meeting with Seren
-   Started using the prompt I create, to get copilot to build my github issues which are looking very good.

### How do you feel about today's progress?

Today was a good day, made some progress with my prompt and have my github issues created now. I will start getting Copilot to work on those issues from Monday or possibly over the weekend. I am happy with todays progress, I am bummed that I am still doing the logs incorrectly. I have a new strategy for logs now provided by Ash that I will follow.

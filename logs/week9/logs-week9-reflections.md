# Week 09 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### Courses Completed

#### Project Management (Day 2)

-   [x] Asana Foundations course (3.0 hrs)

#### Technical Research & Documentation (Various Days)

-   [x] SASS/SCSS documentation research and study (2.0 hrs total)
-   [x] Custom post type plugin development research (1.0 hrs)

**Total Learning Time**: 6.0 hrs completed

### What went well?

Excellent progress on strategic planning and foundation work that will accelerate future development. Successfully completed Asana Foundations course, gaining valuable project management skills that immediately improved task organization and workflow efficiency. Made significant breakthrough with custom post type plugin development - achieved 70% completion working collaboratively with Copilot, demonstrating growing confidence with both WordPress development and AI-assisted coding. Created comprehensive custom Copilot instructions that generated 12 well-structured GitHub issues (1 EPIC + 11 sub-issues) following Ash's requirements, establishing clear roadmap for upcoming work. Maintained excellent team communication through regular meetings with Ash, Seren, and Barbara, ensuring alignment and receiving valuable guidance. Technical learning advanced substantially with SASS/SCSS documentation study and "Build your first block theme" tutorial completion. Repository management improved with proper release tagging and changelog updates, maintaining clean project history. Fixed mobile menu background issue efficiently. Week concluded with strong momentum, clear next steps, and GitHub issues ready for implementation.

### What can be improved?

Day 1 started slower with more foundational/planning work rather than hands-on implementation, though this proved valuable for the week's overall productivity. Personal commitments on Day 3 (helping brother-in-law) caused a late start, but recovery was good - better advance planning for known interruptions could maintain momentum. Logging consistency remains a challenge despite new strategy from Ash - need to implement the improved logging approach more systematically. While CPT plugin development progressed to 70% completion, finishing the final 30% stretched longer than anticipated. Time allocation between learning (7 hours total) and practical implementation could be optimized to ensure immediate application of new concepts. The extensive GitHub issue creation process, while thorough, took significant time that could have been allocated to actual implementation work.

### What have you learned?

Mastered the art of collaborative development with AI tools - working with Copilot to build the CPT plugin showed how AI can accelerate development while maintaining code quality and learning opportunities. Gained practical project management skills through Asana Foundations completion, learning to better organize tasks, track progress, and communicate effectively with team members. Developed advanced GitHub workflow understanding including proper release management, changelog maintenance, and issue structuring - created comprehensive issue templates that will streamline future development cycles. Learned the power of strategic planning and documentation - creating custom Copilot instructions and structured GitHub issues provides clear roadmaps that reduce confusion and increase productivity. Enhanced technical knowledge significantly through SASS/SCSS study and WordPress block theme tutorial, building foundation for more advanced styling and theme development. Understood the importance of balancing learning with implementation - while 7 hours of courses provided valuable knowledge, immediate application ensures retention and practical value. Experienced how consistent team communication (regular meetings with Ash, Seren, Barbara) provides both guidance and accountability, creating supportive environment for growth and problem-solving.

### What are your next actions?

-   Complete the final 30% of CPT plugin development and prepare zip file for Chris's review upon his return
-   Begin systematic implementation of the 12 GitHub issues created this week, starting Monday or potentially over the weekend
-   Apply the new logging strategy provided by Ash to improve documentation consistency and accuracy
-   Utilize the custom Copilot instructions for future issue creation and development workflow optimization
-   Continue expanding SASS/SCSS knowledge and apply learnings to current theme styling challenges
-   Leverage completed Asana Foundations training to improve project management and task tracking efficiency
-   Build on successful AI-collaborative development approach established with CPT plugin work
-   Maintain the positive team communication patterns established through regular meetings with Ash, Seren, and Barbara
-   Focus on immediate application of new technical knowledge to maximize retention and practical value
-   Prepare for productive next week by having clear, structured GitHub issues and development roadmap ready
